===== Introduction to translationAcademy =====

This module answers the question: What is translationAcademy?\\
==== Welcome to translationAcademy ====

The “translationAcademy” is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of Biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure. 

translationAcademy contains the following sections:
  * [[:zh:ta:vol1:intro:toc_intro]] - introduces the unfoldingWord project
  * [[:zh:ta:vol1:process:toc_processvol1_2]] - answer the question "what next?"
  * [[:zh:ta:vol1:translate:toc_transvol1_2]] - explains the basics of translation theory and practical translation helps
  * [[:zh:ta:vol1:checking:toc_checkvol1_2]] - explains the basics of checking theory and best practices
  * [[:zh:ta:vol1:tech:toc_techvol1_2]] - explains how to use the different technology tools
  * [[:zh:ta:vol2:audio:toc_audiovol2]] - How to do high quality audio recordings
  * [[:zh:ta:vol2:gateway:toc_gatewayvol2]] - explains issues specific to the Gateway Langauges

Several of the manuals are separated into two volumes. Volume 1 of each manual covers the basics of that subject while volume 2 goes more in depth. In general, if a module is needed to translate and publish Open Bible Stories, then it is included in volume 1, if not, then it is included in volume 2.
