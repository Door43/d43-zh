当上帝创造世界时，一切都是完美的。没有罪。亚当和夏娃彼此相爱，而且他们也爱上帝。并没有死亡、疾病或痛苦。上帝想要一切都能都是这样。
(BT When God created the world, everything is perfect. No sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no death ,sickness or pain. God want everything will be like this.)

When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no death or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.

撒旦，就是在伊甸园里的蛇，欺骗夏娃，亚当和夏娃就犯罪得罪了上帝。因为他们犯罪，死亡、疾病和痛苦就成为地上每个人生命的一部份。
(BT Satan, the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, then Adam and Eve sinned against God. Death, sickness and pain are the part of life on earth because of the sin.)

Satan, who was the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, and she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, death, sickness, and pain all became part of life for everyone on earth.

甚至更糟的是，他们与上帝之间的关系破坏了。现在，因为罪，每个人一出生就成了上帝的敌人。但是上帝有计划去修复因罪所受到破坏的一切事情.
(BT Even worse, the ralationship between God and them was broken. Now, because of sin, everyone becomes the enemy of God when they were born.) 

Even worse, their relationship with God was broken. Now, everyone is born an enemy of God because of sin. But God had a plan to fix everything that had been broken by sin.

上帝应许夏娃的一个后裔将会打破撒旦的头，撒旦也会伤他的脚跟。也就是说撒旦会杀死耶稣，但是上帝会在三天后使他从死里复活。耶稣会永远打破撒旦的权柄。
(BT God promised that one decendent of Eve would crash the head of Satan and the Satan would hurt his heel. It means that Jesus will be killed by Satan, but God will raise Him from the death after three days. Jesus will break the power of Satan forever.)

God promised that one of Eve’s descendant would crush Satan’s head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill Jesus, but God would raise him to life after three days. Jesus would crush the power of Satan forever.

当上帝用洪水毁坏全地时，他为那些相信他的人提供了船作为得救的方法。同样地，虽然因为罪所有人都当受灭亡，但是上帝已为凡信耶稣的人提供了得救的方法。
(BT When God destroyed the earth by flood. He provided a boat as the way of salvation for the people who believe in Him. In the same way, even though everyone deserves death because of their sins, God provide a way of salvation for the people who believe in Jesus.)

When God destroyed the whole earth in the flood, He provided the boat as a way of salvation for those who believed in Him. In the same way, though everyone deserves to be destroyed for their sins, God has provided a way of salvation for everyone who believes in Jesus.

麦基洗德是祝福亚伯拉罕的祭司。像麦基洗德一样，耶稣是一位也是位祭司，但是耶稣是最大的祭司。耶稣只一次献上，就是他自己。唯有耶稣的祭才能除去世人的罪。
(BT Melchizedek is the priest who gave blessing to Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest, but He the great high priest. Jesus offered once for the sacrifice, himself. Nothing can take away the sin of the whole world but the sacrifice of Jesus.)

Melchizedek was a priest who blessed Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest, but Jesus is the Great High Priest. Jesus offered only one sacrifice, himself. This was the only sacrifice needed to take away the sin of the whole world.

上帝对亚伯拉罕说：“籍着你，地上的万民都必蒙福。”。耶稣是亚伯拉罕的后裔。地上的万民都因着耶稣蒙福，因为所有信他的人就成了上帝的选民，亚伯拉罕属灵的后裔。
(BT God told Abraham, " Through you, every nation on earth will be blessed." Jesus is a descendent of Araham. Every nation on earth is blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in Jesus becomes the chosen people of God, the descendent of Abraham.)

God told Abraham, “Through you, all the people groups of the earth will be blessed.” Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups of the earth are blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God’s chosen people, a spiritual descendant of Abraham.

上帝赐给亚伯拉罕一只公山羊来代替以撒成为献上的祭物。耶稣就像这只山羊一样因为他替我们死了。所有人都因为罪当受死，也包括你！但是上帝赐下耶稣作为祭物替我们受死。
(BT God provided a ram to be a sacrifice for Abraham instead of Issac. Jesus is like the ram because He died for us. everyone deserves to die because of their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of us.)

God provided a ram for Abraham to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Jesus is like that ram because he died instead of us. Everyone deserves to die for their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of you.

当上帝在埃及施行最后一灾时，每个以色列家庭都需要杀一只无残疾的羊，并将血洒在门的周围。当耶和华的使者看到血时，他就会越过他们的房子不杀他们头生的儿子。
(BT When God sent the last plague in Egypt, every Israelite family needed to kill a perfect lamb, and spread the blood around the door. When the angel of God saw the blood, He will pass over their houses and not kill their first born son.)

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, each Israelite family needed to kill a perfect lamb and spread the blood around their doors. When the angel of God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons.

耶稣是我们逾越节的羔羊。他是完全的，无罪的，在逾越节时被杀。任何相信耶稣的人，耶稣的血就洗净他的罪，他也不会受到上帝的惩罚。
(BT Jesus is our Passover's Lamb. He is perfect, sinless,  and He is killed on Passover Festival. Anyone who believe in Jesus, his sin is washed away by the blood of Jesus, and God will pass over his punishment.)

上帝与他的选民以色列人立约。上帝所立的新约中，每个民族的每个人都可以因着相信耶稣成为上帝的选民。
(BT God made a covenant with His chosen people Israelites. In the New Covenant, everyone in every nation can be the chosen people of God by believing in Jesus.)

God made a covenant with the Israelites who were His chosen people. In God’s New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God’s chosen people by believing in Jesus.

摩西是一个伟大的先知，他宣布上帝的话。耶稣像摩西一样是个先知，但是耶稣是最大的先知。他是上帝的道。
