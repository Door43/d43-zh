The crowd had over 5,000 men in it, **not counting the women and children**. **Jesus** felt great compassion towards the people. **To Jesus**, these people were **like sheep without a shepherd**. So he taught them and **healed** the people among them who were sick.

这人群中，不算妇人和孩子，有五千人。耶稣就大大地怜悯他们。耶稣看这些人就像没有牧人的羊群。耶稣就教导他们并医治他们的疾病。
