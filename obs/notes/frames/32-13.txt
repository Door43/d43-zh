**Jesus** returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there, a large crowd gathered around him and **pressed in on him**. In the crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would **heal** her, but **she only got worse**.

耶稣回到加利利海的另一边。一大群人聚集在他周围。在这人群中，有一个妇人患了血漏12年。她为治这病花光了所有的钱，但病却变得更糟了。
