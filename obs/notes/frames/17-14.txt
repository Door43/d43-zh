But as **punishment** for **David's sin**, his baby boy died. There was also **fighting in David’s family** for the rest of his life, and **David’s power was greatly weakened**. Though David had been unfaithful to **God**, God was still **faithful** to his **promises**. Later, David and Bathsheba had another son, and they named him **Solomon**.

但作为罪的惩罚，大卫的儿子死了，在他的余生里，家中也一直有争战，他的势力也大大的削弱了。尽管大卫曾对神不忠，但神是信实的，恪守着他的应许。拔示巴又给大卫生了一个儿子，叫所罗门。
