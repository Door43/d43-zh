Immediately, fire **fell from the sky** and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the dirt, and even the water that was around the **altar**. When the people saw this, they **fell on the ground** and said, “**Yahweh is God**! Yahweh is God!”

立刻，火从天上降下，烧着了祭品，木头，岩石，甚至祭坛周围的地面。人们看到这些，纷纷跪在地上说，“主是神！主是神！”
