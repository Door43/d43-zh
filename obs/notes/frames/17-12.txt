{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-17-12.jpg?nolink}}

**Bathsheba's** husband, a man named **Uriah**, was one of **David's** best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to **go be with his wife**. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him **where the enemy was strongest** so that he would be killed.

她的丈夫，乌利亚是大卫最好的士兵之一。大卫差人把乌利亚从战场带回到他的妻子身边。乌利亚拒绝回家去，因为其他士兵还在战场杀敌。大卫就把乌利亚放在敌人最凶猛的地方，乌利亚因此被杀了。
