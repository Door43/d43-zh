{{:en:obs:obs-16-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

That night **God** told **Gideon**, “**Go down** to the **Midianite** camp and when you hear what they say, you will **no longer be afraid**.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about **something he had dreamed**. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat the Midianite army!” When Gideon heard this, he **worshiped** God.

当天晚上上帝对基甸说：”去到米甸人的军营听听他们如何说，之后你便不会惧怕了。“所以基甸去了去了米甸人的军营，听到一个米甸士兵在和他的朋友说一个梦。他的朋友说，这个梦预示着基甸将会大败米甸。基甸敬拜了大能的主。
