Immediately, **Jesus** realized that **power had gone out from him**. So he turned around and asked, “Who touched me?” The **disciples** replied, “There are many people crowding around you and bumping into you. **Why did you ask, ‘Who touched me?’**”

耶稣立刻意识到有能力从他出来。他便转头问道，“谁碰了我？”门徒说道，“耶稣，有很多人在你周围挤住你，你还问，'谁碰我？'”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **power had gone out from him** - This may be translated as, "healing power had flowed from him into someone else" or, "his power had healed someone." Jesus did not lose any power because of this.
  * **Why did you ask, 'Who touched me?'** - In some languages it may be better to use an indirect quote here such as, "Why did you ask who was touching you?" or, "Why you are wondering who touched you?"
