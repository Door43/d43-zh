Every **Egyptian** firstborn male died, **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail**, **to the firstborn of Pharaoh**. Many people in **Egypt** were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.

从狱中罪犯的头生的儿子，到法老头生的儿子，每个头生的，都被杀了。在埃及遍地有哀哭。

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh** - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son died–from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.
