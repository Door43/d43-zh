Ten years after **Abram** and **Sarai** arrived in **Canaan**, **they still did not have a child**. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, “Since **God** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my **servant**, **Hagar**. **Marry her also** so she can **have a child for me**.” 

亚伯兰和撒萊等了二十多年，仍没有孩子。神对亚伯兰发言，再次允诺他将有一个儿子及如天上星辰般多的后裔。亚伯兰相信神的话。

  * **have a child for me** - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.
