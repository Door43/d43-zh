===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **rich young ruler** - This man was already a rich and powerful political official, even though he was still young.
  * **came up to Jesus** - That is, "approached Jesus."
  * **Good teacher** - That is, "righteous teacher." He was not saying that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher.
  * **to have eternal life** - That is, "to receive eternal life" or, "to live with God forever." Also consider how "eternal life" was translated on **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]** and see the note about that there.
  * **Why do you call me 'good'** - Jesus is not denying that he is God. Rather, he is asking if the ruler understands that Jesus is God.
  * **There is only one who is good, and that is God** - Another way to say this would be, "The only one who is truly good is God" or, "God is the only one who is truly good."
