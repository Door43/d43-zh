Then **Jesus** sat down. Everybody watched him closely. They knew the passage of **scripture** that he had just read referred to the **Messiah**. Jesus said, “**The words I just read to you are happening right now**.” All the people were **amazed**. “**Isn’t this the son of Joseph**?” they said.


讲完耶稣就坐下，会堂里的人都定眼看他。他们知道所讲的和弥赛亚有关。耶稣说：“今天这经应验在你们耳中了。”众人都称赞他，问：“这不是约瑟的儿子吗？”

  * **amazed** - Translate the word "amazed" with a term that means that they were surprised, shocked, and confused about how this could be possible.
  * **Isn't this the son of Joseph?**  –This could also be translated as, "This man is only the son of Joseph!" or, "Everyone knows he is just Joseph's son!"
