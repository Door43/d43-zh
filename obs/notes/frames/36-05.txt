As **Peter** was talking, a bright cloud came down and surrounded them and **a voice from the cloud said**, “This is my **Son** whom I **love**. I am pleased with him. **Listen to him**.” The three **disciples** were **terrified** and **fell on the ground**.

彼得说话的时候，一束光亮的云朵降临到他们头顶，还伴随着一个声音“这是我喜爱的儿子，我非常爱他。你们要听从他。"
