After the two days had passed, **Jesus** said to his **disciples**, “Let’s go back to **Judea**.” “But **Teacher**,” the disciples answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!” Jesus said, “Our friend **Lazarus has fallen asleep**, **and I must wake him**.”

有一天，耶稣得知拉撒路病的非常严重。拉撒路，和他的两个姐姐，玛利亚和马大，都是耶稣的好朋友。耶稣听到这个消息后，说道，“这病不至于死，而是为神带来荣耀。”耶稣爱他的朋友们，于是他在原地等了两天。

  * **Judea** - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say, "the region of Judea."
  * **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.** - Translate this phrase with the normal words for "asleep" and "wake" in your language. Although Jesus was using these words with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.
