===== Gideon's Army [16-12] =====

Then **Gideon** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a **horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded the camp where the **Midianite** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.


后来，基甸来到以色列士兵那里，给每个人发了号角，粘土锅还有一个火炬。他们趁米甸人睡觉的时候将他们包围了。这300个人将火炬统统放入锅中，这样就没有人看到他们了。

==== Important Terms: ====


  * **[[:zh:obe:other:Gideon]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:other:Midian]]**


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **horn** - This could be translated as, "trumpet" or, "ram's horn trumpet." These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle.
  * **a torch** - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.)
