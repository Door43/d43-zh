{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-07-03.jpg?nolink}}

**Isaac** wanted to **give his blessing** to **Esau**. But before he did, **Rebekah** and **Jacob tricked him** by having Jacob **pretend** to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put **goatskins** on his neck and hands. 

以撒年老的时候，他想祝福以扫。但在这之前，利百加和雅各骗了他，雅各假装成以扫。雅各穿上以扫的衣服，把山羊皮包在手上和颈部。

  * **tricked him** - The word "trick" means to do something to deliberately deceive someone. Rebekah came up with a plan to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the special blessing instead of Esau.
  * **pretend** - The word "pretend" shows how Jacob would deceive his father (who had very poor eyesight in his old age).
  * **goatskins** - The hairiness of the goatskins would make Jacob feel like Esau.
