===== Rebekah and Jacob Tricked Isaac [07-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Isaac** wanted to **give his blessing** to **Esau**. But before he did, **Rebekah** and **Jacob tricked him** by having Jacob **pretend** to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put **goatskins** on his neck and hands. 

以撒年老的时候，他想祝福以扫。但在这之前，利百加和雅各骗了他，雅各假装成以扫。雅各穿上以扫的衣服，把山羊皮包在手上和颈部。

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **give his blessing** - It was customary for fathers to formally express their desire for good things to happen to their children. Normally the older son received the best promise. Isaac wanted this extra prosperity to happen to Esau.
  * **tricked him** - The word "trick" means to do something to deliberately deceive someone. Rebekah came up with a plan to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the special blessing instead of Esau.
  * **pretend** - The word "pretend" shows how Jacob would deceive his father (who had very poor eyesight in his old age).
  * **goatskins** - The hairiness of the goatskins would make Jacob feel like Esau.
