So **Pharaoh** and his army chased after the **Israelites** to **make them their slaves again**. When the Israelites saw the **Egyptian** army coming, they realized **they were trapped between Pharaoh's army and the Red Sea**. They were very afraid and cried out, “**Why did we leave Egypt**? We are going to die!”


所以法老和他的军队就追赶以色列人，使他们继续做奴隶。当以色列看见埃及军队正在临近，发现自己身陷敌军和红海之间，就非常得害怕，哭喊道：“我们为什么要离开埃及啊？我们会死在这里啊!"

  * **they were trapped between…Red Sea** - Another way to say this would be, "there was nowhere they could go to escape since the Egyptians were behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them."
  * **Why did we leave Egypt?** – This means, "We should not have left Egypt!" They were not really asking for reasons. Because they were afraid, in this moment they were wishing they had not left Egypt (even though it had been very difficult for them there).
