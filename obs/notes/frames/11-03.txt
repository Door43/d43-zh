**God** told the **Israelites** to put some of the **lamb's blood** around the door of their house, and to roast the meat and eat it quickly, along with bread that was **made without yeast**. He also told them to be ready to leave **Egypt when they ate**.


他们要在自己家房屋的门框和门楣上涂上一些血，要烤了羊，并同无酵饼一起吃。他们吃的时候就要准备好离开埃及。

==== Important Terms: ====


  * **[[:zh:obe:kt:God]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:other:Israel]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:kt:lamb]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:kt:blood]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:other:Egypt]]**


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **made without yeast** – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as, "made without something that would make it rise." Making the bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly.
  * **when they ate** – This means they needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat.
