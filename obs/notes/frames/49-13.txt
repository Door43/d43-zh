===== God Loves You [49-13] =====

{{:en:obs:obs-49-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**God** will **save** everyone who **believes** in **Jesus** and **receives** him as their **Master**. But he will not save anyone who does not believe in him. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you live. God **loves** you and wants you to believe in Jesus so **he can have a close relationship with you**.

任何相信耶稣并受洗的人都可以得救，但那些不相信的就不能得救。这跟你无论是富有还是贫穷，是男人还是女人，是老人还是小孩，是来自哪里没有关系。神爱你，想要你相信耶稣，这样，他就能和你建立关系。
