Then the **Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites**. There were so many of them that **they could not be counted**. **Gideon** called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked **God for two signs** so he could be sure **that God would use him to save Israel**.


后来米甸人又来盗窃以色列人。米甸人数量之多，数不胜数。基甸号召以色列人同心协力起来反抗。他请求上帝给了两个暗示，以此确保上帝是派遣他来拯救以色列民的。
