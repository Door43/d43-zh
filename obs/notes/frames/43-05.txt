Some of the people **accused the disciples of being drunk**. But **Peter** stood up and said to them, “Listen to me! These people are not drunk! This **fulfills** the **prophecy** made by the prophet **Joel** in which God said, ‘In **the last days**, I will **pour out my Spirit**.’”

一些人说门徒只是喝醉了，但是彼得站起来说：“听我说，这些人不是喝醉了。这正是验证了先知约珥所说的，‘在末后的日子，我要将我的灵浇灌出来。’”
