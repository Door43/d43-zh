**God** commanded the **Israelites** to celebrate **the Passover** every year in order to **remember how God gave them victory over** the **Egyptians** and rescued them from being **slaves**. They celebrated by killing a **perfect lamb**, eating it with **unleavened bread**, and telling about how God had **saved** them.

神命令以色列民纪念神为他们击败埃及人以及把他们从奴役中解救出来的荣耀，因此他们每年都庆祝逾越节。他们会杀掉一只完美的羊羔，预备一场盛宴，并且来分享神如何把他们从埃及地解救出来的故事。
