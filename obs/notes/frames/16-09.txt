===== The Wet Cloth [16-09] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-09.jpg?nolink}}

For the first **sign**, **Gideon** laid a cloth on the ground and asked **God** to **let the morning dew fall** only on the cloth and not on the ground. **God did that**. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too. These two signs convinced Gideon that God would use him to **save Israel** from the **Midianites**.


首先他在地上铺了一块布，求上帝使清晨的露珠单单落在这布上。上帝成全了。次日晚上，他请求上帝使地面潮湿，唯有布是干的。上帝也成全了。
