===== The Virgin Birth [49-01] =====

{{:en:obs:obs-49-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

An angel told a **virgin** named **Mary** that she would give birth to **God's Son**. So while she was still a virgin, she gave birth to a son and named him **Jesus**. Therefore, Jesus is both God and human.

耶稣的妈妈，玛利亚，在他出生的时候还是一个处女，因为耶稣是神的儿子。耶稣同时是神又是人。
