==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **suffering of my people** - This could be translated as, "the very harsh treatment that my people are experiencing. Some languages might translate this as, "how the Egyptians are giving my people terrible pain."
  * **my people** - This refers to the Israelites. God had made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants that He would bless them and make them into a great nation. Through this covenant, the Israelites became God's own people.
  * **bring … out of their slavery in Egypt** - This can be translated as, "set them free from being slaves in Egypt" or, "bring them out of Egypt where they are now slaves."
