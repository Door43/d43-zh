The soldiers brought **Jesus** to a place called “**the Skull**” and nailed his hands and feet to the **cross**. But Jesus said, “**Father**, **forgive them**, **because they do not know what they are doing**.” **Pilate** commanded that they write, “**King of the Jews**” on a sign and put it on the cross above Jesus’ head.

他们来到一个叫“骷髅”的地方，把耶稣的手脚钉在十字架上。但是耶稣却祷告说：“父啊，请原谅他们，因为他们自己在做什么。”彼拉多吩咐人把写着“犹太人的王”的牌子放在耶稣头上。
