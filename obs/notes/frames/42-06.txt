As the **disciples** were talking, **Jesus** suddenly appeared in the room with them and said, “**Peace to you**!” The **disciples** thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, “Why are you afraid and **doubting**? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do.” **To prove** that he was not a ghost, he asked for something to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.
