Then **Jesus** cried out, “**It is finished**! **Father**, I give my **spirit into your hand**s.” Then he **bowed his head** and **gave up his spirit**. When he **died**, there was an earthquake and the **large curtain** that separated the people from the presence of **God** in the **Temple** was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

耶稣大声呼喊说：“成了！我把我的灵交托在你手上。”然后低下头，将自己的灵魂交付神了。他死的时候，有地震发生，将殿里的幔子（用来将人和神分开）从上到下撕开了。
