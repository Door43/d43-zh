Then **God provided a deliverer** who rescued them from their enemies and **brought peace** to **the land**. But then **the people forgot about God** and started **worshiping idols** again. So God allowed the **Midianites**, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.

于是上帝派遣了一位士师，使他们脱离了敌人的攻打，重新回到了和平，安宁的生活。但是他们随后又忘记了上帝的恩典，再次崇拜偶像。所以上帝让处于他们周边的米甸部落将他们打败。
