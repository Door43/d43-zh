**God** also gave the **Israelites a detailed description** of a tent he wanted them to make. **It was called** the **Tent of Meeting**, and it had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. Only the **high priest** was allowed to go into **the room behind the curtain**, because **God lived there**.

为了让以色列人造出合他心意的帐幕，神给了他们一套详细的指示。那帐幕被称为会幕。会幕有两个房间，用一个很大的帘子隔开。除了大祭司，没有人可以进入到帘子后面的房间，因为神住在那里。
