===== Cyrus Sent Judah Home [20-12] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-20-12.jpg?nolink}}

The **Persian Empire** was strong but **merciful** to the people it conquered. Shortly after **Cyrus** became king of the Persians, he gave an order that any **Jew** who wanted to **return to Judah** could leave Persia and go back to Judah. He even gave them money to rebuild the **Temple**! So, after seventy years in **exile**, a small group of Jews **returned** to the city of **Jerusalem** in Judah.


居鲁士执政不久，他就做了一件在历史上绝无仅有的壮举。他颁布一条法令：犹太人可以自由重返自己的犹大国故土。他甚至出资让犹太人重建神殿。被放逐了70年后，一小群的犹太人返回到耶路撒冷城。
