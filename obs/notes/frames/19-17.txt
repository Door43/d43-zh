===== Jeremiah Suffered for God [19-17] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Most of the time, the people did not **obey God**. They often mistreated the **prophets** and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet **Jeremiah** was put into a **dry well** and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the **king had mercy on him** and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.


大多数时候，人们不会听先知的话。他们经常虐待先知，甚至会杀掉他们。有一次，先知耶利米被丢到一口枯井里等死。他沉到井底的泥里，但是国王怜悯他，在他快死之前将他拉了出来。
