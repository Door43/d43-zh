**
Then Satan** took **Jesus** to the highest point on the **Temple** and said, “If you are the **Son of God**, **throw yourself down**, because **it is written**, ‘**God** will command his **angels** to carry you **so your foot does not hit a stone**.’”

撒旦带着耶稣到殿顶上说：“你若是神的儿子，跳下去，因为经上记着说‘主要为你吩咐他的使者用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上’”。
