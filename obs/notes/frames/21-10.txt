{{:en:obs:obs-21-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **prophet Isaiah** said the Messiah would live in **Galilee**, comfort **broken-hearted people**, and **proclaim freedom to captives** and **release to prisoners**. He also predicted that the **Messiah** would **heal** sick people and those who **could not hear**, **see**, **speak**, **or walk**.

先知们也预言了弥赛亚的出生地。以赛亚说他住在加利利，安慰受伤的心，向被俘的传讲自由，向罪犯传讲释放。他也预言弥赛亚会治好生病的人，包括那些不能听见，不能看见，不能说话，不能走路的人。
