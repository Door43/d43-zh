===== Destroy the Canaanites [14-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**God** told the **Israelites**, “You must **get rid of** all the **Canaanites** in the **Promised Land**. **Do not make peace with them** and **do not marry them**. You must completely destroy all of their **idols**. If you do not **obey** me, **you will worship their idols** instead of me.”

神告诉以色列人，“你必要除灭这地上的迦南人。不要和他们交好，也不要与他们婚配。你们必要彻底摧毁他们所有的偶像。如果你们不这么做，就会去敬拜他们的偶像，而不是敬拜我。”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **get rid of** - This could be translated as, "get them out of the land" or, "remove them from the land."
  * **Do not make peace with them** - This could be translated as, "Do not live peacefully among or alongside them" or, "Do not promise to live peacefully with them."
  * **do not marry them** - God did not want any Israelite person to marry any Canaanite person.
  * **you will worship their idols** - If the Israelites became friends with the Canaanites and did not destroy the idols, they would be tempted to worship those idols instead of God. You could say, "you will end up worshiping" to make it clear that this would result from living so close to the Canaanites and learning their ways.
