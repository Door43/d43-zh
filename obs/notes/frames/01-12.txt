  * **[[:zh:obe:kt:good]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:other:Adam]]**


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **not good** - This is the first time that anything in creation was not good. It means it was, "not yet good" because God was not finished with the creation of humans.
  * **alone** - Adam was the only human, with no possibility of a relationship with another person, and unable to reproduce children and multiply.
  * **Adam's helper** - There was no one who was similar enough to Adam to join with him to accomplish the task that God gave to him. None of the animals could do this.
