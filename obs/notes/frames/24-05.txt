Some **Jews** asked **John** if he was the **Messiah**. John replied, “I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. **He is so great** that I am **not even worthy to untie his sandals**.”
===== Important Terms: =====

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:key-terms/jew|Jews]]**
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:key-terms/john-baptist|John]]**
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He is so great** - This could be translated as, "He is so important."
  * **not even worthy to untie his sandals** - In other words, "compared to him, I am not important enough to do even the most menial task for him." Untying sandals was a very low job, something a slave would do.
