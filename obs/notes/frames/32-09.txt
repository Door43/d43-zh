When the people who took care of the pigs saw **what happened**, they ran into the town and told everyone that they met what **Jesus** had done. The people from the town came and saw the man **who used to have the demons**. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.

那看守猪的人看到所发生的一切，跑去告诉所有人耶稣所做的。城里所有的人都跑来看那曾被鬼附的人。他坐着，穿着衣服，行为像个正常人。
