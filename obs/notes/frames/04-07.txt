One day, **Abram** met **Melchizedek**, the **priest** of **God Most High**. Melchizedek **blessed** Abram and said, “May God Most High who **owns heaven and earth** bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned. 

「我必使你的后裔成为一个大国，我将是你的神，我会祝福那些祝福你的人，诅咒那些咒骂你的人。世界各国将因你而得福。」 神还要亚伯兰为家中所有的男性割损，作为盟约的标记。亚伯兰遂听从了。
