===== Barnabas and Saul [46-10] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-46-10.jpg?nolink}}

**One day**, while the Christians at Antioch were **fasting** and **praying**, the **Holy Spirit** said to them, “**Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do**.” So **the church** in Antioch **prayed** for **Barnabas** and **Saul** and **placed their hands on them**. Then they **sent them out** to **preach** the **good news** about **Jesus** in many other places. Barnabas and Saul taught people from different people groups, and many people **believed** in Jesus.

接着，神向那里的一个名叫亚拿尼亚的门徒显现并说：“去一个叫保罗的人那里。伸手在他身上，可使他眼睛可以看见。我已经选他向未得救的人宣扬我的名。我也要指示他，为我的名必须受很多苦难。” 因此亚拿尼亚为保罗祷告，保罗也重新可以看见。
