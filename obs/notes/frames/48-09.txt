When **God sent the last plague on Egypt**, he told each **Israelite** family to kill **a perfect lamb** and spread **its blood** on the tops and sides of their **door frames**. When God saw the blood, he **passed over** their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event is called the **Passover**.
