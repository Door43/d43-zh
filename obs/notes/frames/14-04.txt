{{:en:obs:obs-14-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the **Israelites** reached the border of **Canaan**, **Moses** chose twelve men, one from each tribe of **Israel**. He gave the men instructions to go and **spy on the land** to see what it was like. They were also to **spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak**.

以色列人到达迦南边境后，摩西从十二个支派中各选出一个人。他指示这些人去窥探那地的情形。他们也去窥探那地的迦南人是强壮还是瘦弱。
