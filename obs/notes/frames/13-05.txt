“Do not make **idols** and do not **worship** them, because **I**, **Yahweh**, **am a jealous God**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**. Be sure to keep the **Sabbath day holy**. That is, do all your work in six days, for the **seventh day** is a day for you to rest and **to remember me**.”

“不要制作偶像，也不要敬拜他们。因为我，你的神你的主，是妒忌的神。不要亵渎你神的名。记住要守安息圣日。在六日内做完所有的工，第七日要用来休息，以纪念你的神。”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * (God continues speaking to Moses.)
  * **I, Yahweh, am a jealous God** - This could be translated as, "I, Yahweh, will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides me." God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master of their lives.
  * **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way** - This could be translated as, "Do not talk about me in a way that does not show respect and honor" or, "Talk about me in a way that gives me proper respect and honor."
  * **seventh day** - To translate this, it is best to use the number ("seventh") rather than give the name of a specific day of the week.
  * **to remember me** - This could be translated as, "to keep me in mind" or, "to honor me."
