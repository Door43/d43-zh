{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-27-08.jpg?nolink}}

“The next person to **walk down** that road was a **Samaritan**. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews who had married people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So he cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

下一位路过的是一个撒玛利亚人。(撒玛利亚人是犹太族和其它民族的后裔。撒玛利亚人和犹太人曾经互相憎恨彼此。）当撒玛利亚人看见这个人时，他充满了同情，怜悯。他细心照顾他，并且为他包扎伤口。
