{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-13-10.jpg?nolink}}

The people all agreed to **obey** the laws that **God** had **given them**, to **worship** only God, and to be **his special people**. But a short time after they **promised** to obey God, they **sinned terribly**.

百姓都说愿意遵守神给他们的律例，只敬拜神，成为神的选民。但仅仅在承诺顺服神之后不久，他们就犯了很大的罪。
