A young man named **Saul** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and **guarded their robes** while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in **Jerusalem** started **persecuting** the followers of Jesus, so the **believers** fled to other places. **But in spite of this**, they **preached** about Jesus everywhere they went.

因此，他们就下了水，腓利为他施洗。从水里上来后，主的灵把腓利提取了别的地方，继续在各城宣传福音。
