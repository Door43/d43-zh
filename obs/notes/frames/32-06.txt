The **man with the demon cried out** in a loud voice, “**What do you want with me**, **Jesus**, **Son** of **the Most High God**? Please do not torture me!” Then Jesus asked the demon, “What is your name?” **He replied**, “My name is **Legion**, because **we are many**.” (A “legion” was a group of several thousand soldiers in the Roman army.)

这人身上的恶鬼大叫说道，“耶稣，至高神的儿子，我与你有什么相干？请不要折磨我！”耶稣问这个人，“你叫什么名字？”他说，“我名叫群，因为我们很多。”（一个群代表6000名士兵。）
