===== Saul Chased David [17-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-17-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Saul** became jealous of the people's **love** for **David**. Saul tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. **One day**, Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding from Saul, but Saul did not see him. David was now very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead, David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes **to prove to Saul** that he would not kill him in order to become **king**.

扫罗开始嫉妒大卫了，还曾多次想杀死他。有天，扫罗找大卫想杀死他，就去了大卫的藏身之洞。大卫擒住了扫罗，没有杀他，反而从身上扯下一块布证明给扫罗看他不会杀掉扫罗取代他的王位。
