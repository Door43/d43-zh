{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-10-02.jpg?nolink}}

**Pharaoh** kept refusing to let **the people** go, so **God** sent **ten terrible plagues** on **Egypt**. Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and **all of Egypt's gods**.

因为法老一直拒绝让以色列民离开埃及，于是神就在埃及地降下了十灾。神想通过这些灾祸，让法老明白他比法老以及埃及所有的神都要伟大。
