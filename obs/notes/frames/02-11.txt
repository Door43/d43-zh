===== God Cursed the Man [02-11] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-11.jpg?nolink}}

**God** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **disobeyed** me. Now the **ground is cursed**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then **you will die**, and your body will **return to dirt**.” The man named his wife **Eve**, **which means** “**life-giver**,” because she would become the **mother of all people**. And God clothed **Adam** and Eve with animal skins. 

神对那人说:「你听从了妻子的话，违背了我。地因此受诅咒，你必劳苦工作才能从地里得吃的。你将死亡，你的身体要归于灰土。」那人给自己的妻子起名叫夏娃，意即「生命，」因为她将成为众生的母亲。
