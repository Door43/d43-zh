Inside the house, the **Jewish leaders put Jesus on trial**. They brought many false **witnesses** who **lied about him**. However, **their statements did not agree with each other**, so the Jewish leaders could not prove **he was guilty of anything**. Jesus did not say anything.

在房里，犹太首领们审问耶稣。他们带来很多人做假见证。但是他们的证词彼此不合，所以无法证明耶稣是有罪的。耶稣什么话也不说。
