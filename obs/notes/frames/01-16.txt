===== God Rested [01-16] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-16.jpg?nolink}}

When **the seventh day** came, **God** had **finished his work**. So **God rested** from all he had been doing. He **blessed the seventh day** and **made it holy**, because on this day he rested from his work. This is how God created **the universe** and everything in it.

到了第七天，神造物的工程已完成，就停止了所作的一切。神赐福给第七天，定为圣日，因为在这一天，神停止了所行的一切创造工作，就安息了。这就是神创造宇宙和万物的来历。
