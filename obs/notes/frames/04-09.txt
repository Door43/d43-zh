Then **God** made a **covenant** with **Abram**. A covenant is an agreement between **two parties**. God said, “I will give you a **son from your own body**. I give the land of **Canaan** to your **descendants**.” But Abram still **did not have a son**.

有一天，亚伯兰遇见了麦基洗德--至高神的祭司。麦基洗德祝福了亚伯兰，并说：「愿天地的主，至高的神赐福与亚伯兰。」 亚伯兰便把所得的十分之一给了麦基洗德。
