**At last it was time for** the **Israelites** to **enter Canaan**, the **Promised Land**. **Joshua** sent **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho** that was **protected by strong walls**. In that city there lived a prostitute named **Rahab** who hid the spies and later helped them to **escape**. She did this because she **believed God**. They promised to protect Rahab and **her family** when the Israelites would destroy Jericho.

终于到了以色列民可以进入到应许之地的时候了。约书亚差派了两个探子进入迦南地和耶利哥城。这城被高大的城墙保护着。一名叫喇合的妓女，因为信神的缘故，救了两个探子并且帮助他们逃跑。两个探子也承诺当神将这座城赐给他们的时候，他们必恩待这个女人和她的家庭。
