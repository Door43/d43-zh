===== Joseph Interpreted the Dream [08-07] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-08-07.jpg?nolink}}

**God** had given **Joseph** the ability to **interpret dreams**, so **Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him** from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, “**God is going to send** seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of **famine**.” 

神给了约瑟解释梦的能力，所以法老让人把约瑟从监狱里带到他面前。约瑟解释了这两个梦的意思，说“神将会给埃及7个丰收年，然后再有7个饥荒年。”

  * **famine** - The gardens and fields would produce so little food that people and animals would not have enough to eat.
