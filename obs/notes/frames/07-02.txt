One day, when **Esau** came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to **Jacob**, “Please **give me some of the food** you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, **give me your rights as the oldest son**.” So Esau gave Jacob his **rights as the oldest son**. Then Jacob gave him some food. 


有一天，以扫狩猎回来，饥肠辘辘，他对雅各说:「请把你所煮的东西分一点给我吃。」雅各回答说:「你要先把长子的名分给我才行。」于是，以扫便把长子的名分给了雅各。雅各就分给了他一些吃的。

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **give me some of the food … give me your rights** – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for "give" here. This would also apply to, "Esau gave … Jacob gave" in the last two sentences.
  * **rights as the oldest son** - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.
