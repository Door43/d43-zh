One of **Jesus' disciples** was a man named **Judas**. Judas was **in charge of the apostles' moneybag**, but he **loved money** and often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived in **Jerusalem**, Judas went to the **Jewish leaders** and offered to **betray** Jesus to them in exchange for money. He knew that the Jewish leaders denied that Jesus was the **Messiah** and that they were plotting to kill him.

耶路撒冷的犹太人首领拒绝承认耶稣就是弥赛亚，他们密谋杀害他。犹大是耶稣的一个门徒。他负责掌管门徒的钱，但他并不诚实，经常偷钱。
