===== At the Promised Land [14-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the **Israelites** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them **who had rebelled against God** were dead. Then God led **the people** to the edge of the **Promised Land** again. **Moses** was now very old, so God chose **Joshua** to help him lead the people. God also **promised** Moses that **one day**, he would send **another prophet like Moses**.

游荡四十年之后，所有悖逆神的人都死了。神便带领以色列民又来到应许之地的边境。摩西已经非常老了，他便选了约书亚帮助他带领百姓。神应许摩西将兴起另一位像他一样的先知。
