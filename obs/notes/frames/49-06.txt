===== Not All Will Be Saved [49-06] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-33-02.jpg?nolink}}

**Jesus** taught that some people will **receive** him and be **saved**, but **others will not**. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the **good news** of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the **seed of God's word** does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into **his kingdom**.

他教导说不是所有的人都会接受他并被救。那些没有被救的将在世界的末了集中起来在地狱之火中被焚烧。
