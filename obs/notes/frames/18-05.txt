After **Solomon** died, his son, **Rehoboam**, became **king**. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of the **nation of Israel** came together to **confirm him as king**. They complained to Rehoboam that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

所罗门死后，他的儿子罗波安继承王位。罗波安是很愚昧的人。以色列人要立他做王。以色列抱怨所罗门让他们做苦工，赋重税。
