===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **riot** - That is, "start doing violent things in their anger."
  * **a royal robe** - That is, "a robe like a king's robe." This robe had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king would wear.
  * **crown made of thorns** - This means that they tied thorn branches into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it.
  * **Look** - That is, "Look at" or, "Here is."
  * **the King of the Jews** - Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus, this could be translated as, "the so-called King of the Jews."
  * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
