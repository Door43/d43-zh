但是彼拉多担心会有暴乱，就将耶稣交给他们去钉十字架。士兵们鞭打耶稣，给他披上一件高贵的袍子，带上一个用荆棘做成的王冠。他们取笑他，说道，“看啊，犹太人的王！”

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **riot**  - That is, "start doing violent things in their anger."
    * **a royal robe**  - That is, "a robe like a king's robe." This robe had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king would wear.
    * **crown made of thorns**  - This means that they tied thorn branches into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it.
    * **Look**  - That is, "Look at" or, "Here is."
    * **the King of the Jews**  - Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus, this could be translated as, "the so-called King of the Jews."
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
