===== Gideon Destroyed the Idol [16-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Gideon's** father had an **altar** dedicated to an **idol**. **God** told Gideon **to tear down** that altar. But Gideon was **afraid of the people**, so he **waited until nighttime**. Then he tore down the altar and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the altar to the idol used to be and made a **sacrifice** to God on it.

上帝让基甸去摧毁他父亲的偶像。吉迪恩怕众人反对，于是等到夜间才行动。他摧毁了曾经的偶像，重新给上帝建了一座圣坛，并且向上帝献祭。

  * **afraid of the people** - Gideon was afraid that his fellow Israelites who worshiped the same idol would be angry with him.
  * **waited until nighttime** - Another way to say this would be, "waited until after dark." Gideon smashed the altar at night when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.
