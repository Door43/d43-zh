Many **people groups** still have not heard about **Jesus**. Before he returned to **heaven**, Jesus told **Christians** to proclaim the **good news** to people who have never heard it. He said, “Go and **make disciples** of all people groups!” and, “**The fields are ripe for harvest**!”

仍有许多民族没有听说过耶稣。在他去天堂之前，耶稣给基督徒们一个任务，让他们传福音给还没有听过的人。他说，“去叫万民做门徒！地要成熟得丰收!"
