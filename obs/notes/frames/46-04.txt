There was a **disciple** in Damascus named Ananias. **God** said to him, “Go to the house where **Saul** is staying. Place your hands on him so that he can see again.” **But Ananias said**, “**Master**, I have heard how this man has **persecuted** the believers.” **God answered him**, “Go! I have chosen him **to declare my name** to the Jews and to people from other people groups. He will **suffer** many things **for my name**.”

当人们听到这的时候，便塞住耳朵大声叫道。他们把司提反扔出城外，并且用石头砸死了他。
