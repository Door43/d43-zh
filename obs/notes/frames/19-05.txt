{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-05.jpg?nolink}}

After three and a half years, **God** told **Elijah** to return to the **kingdom of Israel** and **speak with Ahab because he was going to send** rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, **you troublemaker**!” Elijah replied to him, “You are the troublemaker! **You have abandoned Yahweh**, the true God, and **worshiped Baal**. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to **Mount Carmel**.”

三年后，神让以利亚回到以色列并与亚哈说话，因为他将再次降雨。亚哈见到以利亚的时候说，“你这个闹事者在这呢。”以利亚说，“你才是闹事者呢！你背弃了真神，却去拜巴力。把以色列人都带到迦密山来！”
