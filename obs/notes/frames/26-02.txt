**Jesus** went to the town of **Nazareth** where he had lived during his childhood. On the **Sabbath**, he went to the **place of worship**. They handed him the **scroll of the prophet Isaiah** so that he would read from it. Jesus **opened up the scroll** and read part of it to the people.


耶稣来到拿撒勒，就是他长大的地方。在安息日，他来岛敬拜的会堂。有人把先知以赛亚的书交给他，耶稣就打开，开始读。
