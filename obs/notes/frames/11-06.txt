===== Death of the Firstborn [11-06] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-11-06.jpg?nolink}}

But the **Egyptians did not believe God or obey his commands**. So God **did not pass over** their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons.

但是埃及人不相信神，也不遵守他的命令。所以神的使者没有越过他们的房子，杀掉了所有埃及人头生的儿子和牲畜。
