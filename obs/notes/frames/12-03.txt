===== Pharaoh Changed His Mind [12-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**After a short time**, **Pharaoh** and his people **changed their minds** and wanted the **Israelites** to be their **slaves** again. **God** caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than Pharaoh and his **gods**.


过了不久，法老和他的人民改变了主意，希望以色列人可以继续被他们奴役。神这样做是要在法老和他的军队上得荣耀，埃及人就知道祂是大而可畏的神了。

  * **After a short time** – Probably at least two days had gone by. For that to be clear, it may be translated as, "After a few days" or, "A few days after the Israelites left Egypt."
  * **changed their minds** - This phrase means, "began to think differently than they had before." Some languages may not have this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.
