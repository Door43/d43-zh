So **God sent a plague of gnats**. Then he sent a plague of **flies**. **Pharaoh** called **Moses** and **Aaron** and told them that if they stopped the plague, the **Israelites** could leave Egypt. When Moses prayed, God removed all the flies from **Egypt**. But Pharaoh **hardened his heart** and would not let the people go free.

神又降下虱灾和蝇灾。法老召来摩西和亚伦，告诉他们如果能停止这些灾祸，以色列人就可以离开。于是摩西向神祷告，神从埃及地移走了所有的苍蝇。但是法老的心又变得刚硬，不愿让以色列人离开。
