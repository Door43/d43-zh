A **king** is someone who rules over a **kingdom** and **judges** the people. The **Messiah** would be the perfect king who would **sit on the throne** of his ancestor **David**. He would reign over **the whole world** forever, and would always judge honestly and make the right decisions.

国王是掌管一个国家并审判人民的人。弥赛亚是完全的国王。他坐在他的祖先大卫的宝座上，永远掌管全世界，实行诚实的审判并永远作正确的决定。
