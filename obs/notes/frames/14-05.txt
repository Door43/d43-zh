The twelve men traveled through **Canaan** for forty days and then **they came back**. They told the people, “The land is very fertile and the crops are plentiful!” But ten of the spies said, “**The cities are very strong** and **the people are giants**! If we attack them, they will certainly defeat us and kill us!”

四十天后之后，这些人回来了。十个探子报告了坏消息，说，“那地是很好的，出产也极丰盛！但那城非常坚固，人也非常巨大！如果攻击他们，我们必死！”

  * **The cities are very strong** - The cities had strong walls around them, so it would be very difficult for the Israelites to attack them.
  * **the people are giants** – This could be translated as, "the people are like giants compared to us!" or, "the people are much taller and stronger than we are!"
