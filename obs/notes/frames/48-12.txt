===== The Word of God [48-12] =====

{{:en:obs:obs-48-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Moses** was **a great prophet** who proclaimed the **word of God**. But **Jesus** is **the greatest prophet** of all. He is **God**, so everything he did and said were the actions and words of God. That is why Jesus is called the Word of God.
