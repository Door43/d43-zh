Jesus said to his **disciples**, “**All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**. So go, **make disciples of all people groups** by **baptizing** them **in the name of** the **Father**, the **Son**, and the **Holy Spirit**, and by teaching them to **obey** everything I have commanded you. Remember, I will be with you always.”

四十天的末尾，耶稣对门徒说，天上的地下的权柄都给了我。去使万国的人做我的门徒，以圣父、圣子、圣灵的名义为他们施洗，并教导他们遵守我一切的命令。
