===== Remain Faithful [50-04] =====

{{:en:obs:obs-50-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Jesus** also said, “A **servant** is** not greater than his master**. Just as the authorities of this world have hated me, they will torture and kill you **because of me**. Although **in this world** you will **suffer**, be encouraged because I have defeated **Satan**, the one who rules this world. If you **remain faithful to me to the end**, then **God will save you**!”


耶稣曾说，“仆人不能高过主人。你们将因为我遭受折磨或被杀。在这个世上，你们会碰到很多麻烦，但要勇敢。我已经打败了撒旦！持守信心到最后，你们就将获救。”
