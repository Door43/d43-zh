**God made** man and woman **in his own image**. He **blessed** them and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was **very good**, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of **creation**. 

神照自己的肖像造了男人和女人，神看了认为好。祂赐福他们并告知:「你们将有许多儿女和子孙，并且充满大地！」这都是在创世的第六天所发生的事。
