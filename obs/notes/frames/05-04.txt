===== God Promised Isaac's Birth [05-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“Your wife, **Sarai**, will have a son—he will be the **son** of **promise**. Name him **Isaac**. **I will make my covenant with him**, and he will become a great nation. I will make **Ishmael** a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac.” Then **God** changed **Abram's** name to **Abraham**, which means “**father of many**.” God also changed Sarai's name to **Sarah**, which means “**princess**.” 


「你的妻子撒萊要生儿子，他才是我所应许的儿子。你要给他起名以撒。我要与他立约，他要成为一个大民族。」之后，神把亚伯兰的名字改为亚伯拉罕，意即「万民之父。」神也把撒萊的名改为撒拉，意即「公主。」

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * (God continues to speak to Abram.)
  * **son of promise** - Isaac would be the son that God promised to Sarai and Abram. He would also be the son that God would use to give Abram many descendants.
  * **I will make my covenant with him** - This would be the same covenant that God made with Abram.
  * **father of many** - As God had promised, Abraham would become the ancestor of many people who would even become many nations.
  * **princess** - A princess is a daughter of a king. The names Sarai and Sarah apparently both meant "princess." But God changed her name to signify that she would be the mother of many nations, and some of her descendants would be kings.
