{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-21-01.jpg?nolink}}

**From the very beginning**, **God** planned to send the **Messiah**. The first **promise** of the Messiah came to **Adam** and **Eve**. God promised that a **descendant** of Eve would be born who would **crush the snake’s head**. **The snake who deceived Eve was Satan**. The promise meant that the Messiah would defeat Satan completely.

第一个对弥赛亚到来的应许来自亚当夏娃时期。神应许从夏娃的后代中将会有人出生重击蛇的头。那欺骗夏娃的蛇就是撒旦。那个应许意味着即将来的弥赛亚将彻底击败撒旦。

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **From the very beginning** - That is, from when the earth was first created.
  * **crush the snake's head** - Unless the head of a venomous snake is crushed, the snake can still hurt someone. Use a word for "crush" that communicates that its head is destroyed.
  * **The snake…was Satan** – Satan spoke to Eve in the form of a snake. This does not mean that he is a snake now. This could be translated as, "The snake…was an appearance of Satan."
  * **who deceived Eve** - That is, "who lied to Eve." The snake lied by making Eve doubt what God had said and tricking her into disobeying God.
