Immediately **Caleb** and **Joshua**, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the **people of Canaan** are tall and strong, but **we can certainly defeat them**! **God will fight for us**!”

另两个探子，迦勒和约书亚，立刻说道，“那地的人确实又高又壮，但是我们能击败他们！神会为我们而战！”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **people of Canaan** – This could be translated as, "the people who live in Canaan" or, "the Canaanites."
  * **we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us** – To show the connection between these two statements, it may be necessary to say, "we can certainly defeat them because God will fight for us!"
  * **God will fight for us** – This could be translated as, "God will fight alongside us and help us defeat them!" This makes it clear that the Israelites would also be fighting against the Canaanites.
