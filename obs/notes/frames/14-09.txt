When the people heard this, they were sorry **they had sinned**. They took their weapons and went to attack the people of **Canaan**. **Moses warned them not to go** because **God was not with them**, **but they did not listen to him**.

百姓听到这些后，为他们犯的罪悔恨。他们就带上武器去攻打迦南地。摩西警告他们不要去，因为神没有与他们同在，但他们不听摩西。

  * **they had sinned** - It may be necessary to add, "they had sinned by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan."
  * **Moses warned them not to go** - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that.
  * **God was not with them** – In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
  * **but they did not listen to him** - They did not obey Moses. They went to attack the Canaanites anyway.
