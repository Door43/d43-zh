**One day**, when Stephen was teaching about **Jesus**, some **Jews** who did not believe in Jesus began to argue with Stephen. They became very angry and lied about Stephen to the **religious leaders**. They said, “We heard him speak **evil** things about **Moses** and **God**!” So the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the **high priest** and the other leaders of the Jews, where more false **witnesses** lied about Stephen.

当他靠近车的时候，腓利听见那人在念先知以赛亚的书，他向羊被牵到宰杀之地，他甚至都没有开口。他被不公地屈辱地对待。他的生命从地上夺去。
