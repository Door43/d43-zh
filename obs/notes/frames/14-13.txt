Another time when the people did not have any water, **God** told **Moses**, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But **Moses dishonored God** in front of all the people **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the **Promised Land**.”

有一次，人们没有水了，神告诉摩西，“对石头说话，水就会出来。”但是摩西违背了神，他当着人们的面用棍子击打了两次岩石，而不是对岩石说话。岩石流出了水让人们喝。但是神对摩西发怒，说，“你必不得进入应许之地。”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **Moses dishonored God** - This could be translated, "Moses disobeyed God" or, "Moses disrespected God." God had a specific way He wanted Moses to show the people God's power to provide for them. When Moses disobeyed God by doing it in a different way he showed a lack of respect for God.
  * **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it** - This can be translated as, "Moses did not speak to the rock; he hit it twice with a stick."
