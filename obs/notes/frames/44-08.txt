**Peter** answered them, “This man stands before you **healed** by the **power** of **Jesus** the **Messiah**. You **crucified** Jesus, but **God raised** him to life again! You **rejected him**, **but there is no other way to be saved except through the power of Jesus**!”

彼得回答道，奉主耶稣基督的名。你们钉死了他，但是神使他从死里复活！你们拒绝了他，但是除他以为别无拯救。
