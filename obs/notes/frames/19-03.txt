**God** told **Elijah** to go to a stream **in the wilderness** to hide from Ahab who wanted to kill him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. **Ahab** and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. **The drought** was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.

神让以利亚藏在一条小溪旁的野地里。每天早晚，有鸟儿为他衔来饼和肉。亚哈和他的军队寻找以利亚，却找不到。
