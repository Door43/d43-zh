**God had told John**, “**The Holy Spirit will come down and rest on** someone you **baptize**. That person is the **Son of God**.” There is only one God. But when John baptized Jesus, he heard **God the Father** speak, he saw God the Son, who is **Jesus**, and he saw God the Holy Spirit.

神曾告诉约翰，“圣灵将降在你所施洗的某个人身上，他就是神的儿子。”神只有一位，但神是三个位份，父，儿子耶稣，和圣灵。
