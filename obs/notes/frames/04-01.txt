**Many years after the flood**, there were **again many people** in the world, and they all spoke the **same language**. Instead of filling the earth as **God** had commanded, they gathered together and built **a city**.

洪水退后多年，地面又出现了许多人，他们都说一样的语言。但是他们不听神的话，不仅不生养大地，反倒结聚一块建造一座城。

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **many years after the flood** - Many generations had passed since the end of the flood.
  * **again many people** - Noah's family multiplied into enough people to fill a city.
  * **same language** - This means there was only one language, so they could all understand each other.
  * **a city** - It is best to use a general word for "city" since the text does not give a specific name.
