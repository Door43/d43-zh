**Jesus** answered, “If **you** want to be **perfect**, then go and sell **everything you own** and give the money to the poor, and you will have **treasure in heaven**. Then come and follow me.”


耶稣回答说：“如果你想要完美，那就变卖你所有的分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上，你还要来跟从我。”

===== Important Terms: =====

  * **[[:zh:obe:kt:Jesus]]**
  * **[[:zh:obe:kt:heaven]]**


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you** - If your language has different words for "you" depending on the number of people intended, use the singular form. Jesus was addressing this command to this one man.
  * **perfect** - That is, "completely righteous."
  * **everything you own** - That is, "all of your possessions."
  * **treasure** - This could also be translated as, "riches" or, "great wealth."
  * **in heaven** - This could also be translated as, "located in heaven when you arrive there." This treasure will exist "there and then," as opposed to the wealth that Jesus asked the young man to give up "here and now."
