===== A New Pharaoh [09-02] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-09-02.jpg?nolink}}

After hundreds of years, the number of **Israelites** had become very large. The **Egyptians** no longer remembered **Joseph** and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the **Pharaoh** who was ruling Egypt at that time **made the Israelites slaves** to the Egyptians. 

很多年之后，一个新的法老掌权。这时埃及人已经忘了约瑟为他们所做的一切。他们害怕以色列人，因为以色列人人口众多。所以他们把以色列人当成奴隶，强迫他们为自己修建房屋和城池。艰苦的劳动使他们苦不堪言，但是神却祝福他们，让他们的子孙越来越多。
