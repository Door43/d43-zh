===== Naaman Came to Elisha [19-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the time of **Elijah**, **God** chose a man named Elisha to be his **prophet**. God did many **miracles** through Elisha. One of the miracles happened to **Naaman**, **an enemy commander**, who had a horrible skin disease. **He had heard of Elisha** so **he went and asked Elisha** to **heal** him. Elisha told Naaman to dip himself seven times in the **Jordan River**.

以利亚以后，神拣选了以利沙作先知。神通过以利沙行了很多神迹。一次，一个叫乃缦的敌军元帅，发现自己得了一种叫大麻疯的皮肤病。他听说过以利沙，于是他去见以利沙，求他医治。以利沙让他将自己浸到约旦河里7次。
