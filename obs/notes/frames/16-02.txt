Because the **Israelites** kept **disobeying God**, he **punished** them by allowing their enemies to defeat them. These enemies stole things from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many of them. After many years of disobeying God and being oppressed by their enemies, the Israelites **repented** and **asked God to rescue them**.

因为他们违背神的旨意，上帝不断派遣他们的敌人来攻打他们，以此作为惩罚。这些敌人偷盗他们，毁坏他们的财物，还杀了很多以色列人。多年以后，以色列人忏悔所犯的罪过并且祈求上帝来拯救他们。
