This is how **the beginning** of everything happened. **God created** the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was **dark** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed** in it. But **God's Spirit** was there over the water.


万物开始的生成是这样的。神在六天内创造了宇宙和万物。起初，大地是黑暗和空虚，大地还是混沌空虚。但神的灵在水面上运行。
