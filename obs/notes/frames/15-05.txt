Then the walls around **Jericho** fell down! The **Israelites** destroyed everything in the city as **God** had commanded. They only spared **Rahab** and her family, who **became part of** the Israelites. When the other people living in **Canaan** heard that the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.

这围绕这城的墙就倒塌了！以色列人按神的命令摧毁了这城的一切。只有喇合和她的家人幸免。她们也成为了以色列的百姓。迦南地其他的人听到耶利哥城的事都十分地害怕。
