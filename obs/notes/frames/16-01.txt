===== Israel Worshiped Idols [16-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After **Joshua** died, the **Israelites disobeyed God** and **did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites** or **obey God's laws**. The Israelites began to **worship** the Canaanite **gods** instead of **Yahweh**, **the true God**. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did **what they thought was right for them**.

约书亚死后，以色列人又不顺服神，他们不再驱赶迦南人，也没有遵守上帝的律法。以色列人开始崇拜迦南人的神，放弃了唯一的真神。以色列人没有国王，所以他们为所欲为。

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **and did not drive out** – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, "They did not."
  * **drive out the rest of the Canaanites** - This can be translated, "fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land."
  * **or obey God's laws** - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
  * **the true God** - That is, "the only real God." Yahweh is the only one that people should worship.
  * **what they thought was right for them** – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.
