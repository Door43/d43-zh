So **God punished both kingdoms** by allowing their enemies to destroy them. The **Assyrian Empire**, a powerful, cruel nation, destroyed the **kingdom of Israel**. The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of Israel, **took away** everything of value, and burned much of the country.

所以神惩罚了以色列人和犹大人，让他们被其它民族摧毁。以色列被一个强大而残酷的亚述族打败。亚述人杀死很多以色列人，掳走他们所有财物，并且几乎烧毁他们的国家。
