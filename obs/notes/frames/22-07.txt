After **Elizabeth** gave birth to her baby boy, **Zechariah** and Elizabeth named the baby **John**, as the **angel** had commanded. Then **God** allowed **Zechariah** to speak again. Zechariah said, “**Praise God**, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, **will be called the prophet** of the **Most High God** who will tell the people how they can receive **forgiveness** for their **sins**!”

当伊丽莎白生下男孩后，他们按照天使的命令，给他起名约翰。神又允许撒迦利亚说话。他说，“赞美神，因为他仍记得他的民！你，我的儿子，将被称为至高神的先知！你将为弥赛亚预备道路！”
