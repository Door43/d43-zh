The next morning the people saw that someone had torn down and destroyed the **altar**, and they were very angry. They went to **Gideon's** house to kill him, but Gideon's father said, “**Why are you trying to help your god**? **If he is a god**, **let him protect himself**!” Because he said this, the people did not kill Gideon.

次日早晨，人们看见偶像被摧毁，于是十分生气。他们来到基甸家中，想要杀死他。但是基甸的父亲说:" 你们为什么企图拯救你们的神呢？如果他们真是上帝，那就让他们自己拯救自己吧！最后，基甸获救了。

  * **Why are you trying to help your god?** - This is not a real question that asks for information. Another way of saying this would be, "You should not be trying to help your god" or, "You should not need to help your god."
  * **If he is a god, let him protect himself** - This means, "If he were truly a god, he would be able to defend himself."
