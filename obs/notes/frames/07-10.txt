But **Esau** had already **forgiven Jacob**, and they were happy to see each other again. Jacob then **lived peacefully** in **Canaan**. Then **Isaac** died, and Jacob and Esau **buried him**. The **covenant promises God** had promised to **Abraham** now **passed on from Isaac to Jacob**. 

其实以扫早已原谅了雅各，他们愉快地团聚。之后雅各平安地住在迦南。以撒死后，雅各和以扫便把他埋葬了。神应许亚伯拉罕的承诺，传给以撒后，现在又传给了雅各。
