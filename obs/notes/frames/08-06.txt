After two years, **Joseph** was still in prison, even though he was **innocent**. One night, the **Pharaoh**, which is what the **Egyptians** called their **kings**, had two **dreams** that **disturbed him greatly**. None of **his advisors** could tell him the **meaning of the dreams**. 

几年之后，尽管是清白的，约瑟仍然在监狱里。埃及的国王，也就是法老，一直被两个梦困扰。他的大臣们没有一个可以告诉他这两个梦的意思。
