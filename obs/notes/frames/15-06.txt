===== The Gibeonites' Lie [15-06] =====


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-15-06.jpg?nolink}}

**God** had commanded the **Israelites** not to make a **peace treaty** with any of the people groups in **Canaan**. **But one of the Canaanite people groups, called the Gibeonites**, **lied to Joshua and said** they were from a place far from Canaan. They asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God **where the Gibeonites were from**. So Joshua made a peace treaty with them.

迦南人的一族，基遍人俯伏在约书亚面前说，他们住在很远的地方。他请求和约书亚和他们立约讲和。神告诉以色列人不要与迦南地的人和平相处，但是约书亚和以色列人没有向神求问，基遍人从哪而来。因此，约束亚就与基遍人立了约。
