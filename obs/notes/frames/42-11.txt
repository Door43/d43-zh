Forty days after **Jesus** rose from the dead, he told his **disciples**, “Stay in **Jerusalem** until my **Father** gives you **power** when the **Holy Spirit comes on you**.” Then Jesus went up to **heaven**, and **a cloud hid him from their sight**. Jesus sat down **at the right hand of God** to rule **over all things**.

“记住，我一直与你们同在。留在l耶路撒冷直到领受从天而来的能力。” 接着，耶稣便被提上天，有云彩遮住了下面人的视线。耶稣坐在上帝的右边，掌管一切。
