定义：

To betray someone is to gain that person's trust, but then to act in a way that deceives that person or is harmful to him in some way.

背叛某人，就是先获得那人的信任，然后行为上再欺骗那人，或在某种程度上再伤害他。

  * Judas was "the betrayer" because he told the Jewish leaders how to capture Jesus.
  * 犹大是“背叛者”，因为他告诉犹太人首领如何去捉住耶稣。
  * The betrayal by Judas was especially evil because Judas was an apostle of Jesus, because Judas betrayed Jesus for money, and because the betrayal ended with the unjust execution of Jesus.
  * 犹大的背叛是特别邪恶的，因为犹大是耶稣的一个门徒，还因为犹大为了钱背叛了耶稣，再因为这背叛以对耶稣不公正的判刑而告终。
