  * 她（马利亚）是个处女，和一个名叫约瑟的男人订了婚，并准备结婚。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:23-01|[23-01]]]****Joseph**, the man Mary was engaged to, was a righteous man. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame her, so he planned to quietly divorce her.
  *
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:23-02|[23-02]]]** The angel said, "**Joseph**, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby in her body is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means, 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins."
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:23-03|[23-03]]]** So **Joseph**  married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:23-04|[23-04]]]****Joseph**  and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:26-04|[26-04]]]** Jesus said, "The words I just read to you are happening right now." All the people were amazed. "Isn't this the son of **Joseph**?" they said.
