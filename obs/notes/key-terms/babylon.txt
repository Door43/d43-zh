  * Babylon was located in the same region where the Tower of Babel had been built hundreds of years before.
  * 巴比伦和几百年前修建的巴别塔位于同一地区。
  * The Babylonians were a powerful people group that attacked the kingdom of Judah and held some of them captive for 70 years.
  * 巴比伦人是个强大的民族，他们攻打了犹大国，把他们当中的一些人虏去长达70年。
  * Sometimes the word "Babylon" is used to refer to the entire Babylonian Empire. The "king of Babylon" was king not only of that city, but of the whole empire.
  * 有时，“巴比伦”这个词用来指整个巴比伦帝国。“巴比伦王”不仅仅是那个城的王，而是整个帝国的王。
