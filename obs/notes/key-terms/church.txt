定义：

The word, "church" refers to a group of people who believe in Jesus. When those believers are in a local area such as a city or a region, it is written as, "church." When it refers to believers everywhere, it is written as, "Church."

小写的“教会”是指一群相信耶稣的人，当这些信仰者在一个地区或城市时，就是小写的“教会”。当指这些信仰者在各地的总称就是大写的“教派” 。

  * The original meaning of the word for "church" in the Bible is "called out (to meet together)."
  * 在圣经中“教会”一词的原意是“受招集而聚在一起”
  * "Church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" of believers. The word “congregation” has a similar meaning. However, the believers are still the “church” even when meaning. However, the believers are still the "church" even when they are not together.
  * “教会”也可以翻译成信仰者的“聚会”或“集会”，和“召集”一词近似。但即使他们不聚在一起，“教堂”一词仍指所有信仰者，即教徒。
  * In the Bible, the word "church" always refers to Christian believers, and never to a building.
  * 在圣经中，“教堂”一词 一直代表基督的信仰者，从来不是指建筑物。
  * The church meets together to pray, teach God's truth, and encourage each other to live in a way that is pleasing to God.
  * 基督徒聚在一起祷告，教导神的真理，互相鼓励，过着受神喜悦的生活。
  * God also calls his people, the Church, to go out and teach the good message about Jesus.
  * 上帝也称那些被他拣选的人为“教堂”，即传教者，他们外出教导传播基督的福音。
