定义：

The word, "church" refers to a group of people who believe in Jesus. When those believers are in a local area such as a city or a region, it is written as, "church." When it refers to believers everywhere, it is written as, "Church."

“<font 14px line-height: 11.1999998092651px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>教会</font>    ”是指一群相信耶稣的人。当这些信徒聚集在某个地区或城市时，就是“<font 14px line-height: 11.1999998092651px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>地方性教会</font>    ”<font 14px line-height: 11.1999998092651px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(小写)</font>    。当指各处信徒的总称，就是“<font 14px line-height: 11.1999998092651px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>普世教会</font>    ” (大写).

  * The original meaning of the word for "church" in the Bible is "called out (to meet together)."
  * 在圣经中“教会”一词的原意是“被召出来而聚集在一起”
  * "Church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" of believers. The word “congregation” has a similar meaning. However, the believers are still the "church" even when they are not together.
  * “教会”也可以翻译成信徒的“聚会”或“集会”，和“会众”一词意义相近。然而，即使信徒不聚在一起的时候，他们仍是“教会”。
  * In the Bible, the word "church" always refers to Christian believers, and never to a building.
  * 在圣经中，“教会”一词 一直是指基督徒，从来不是指一个建筑物。
  * The church meets together to pray, teach God's truth, and encourage each other to live in a way that is pleasing to God.
  * 教会聚在一起祷告，教导神的真理，互相鼓励，过神所喜悦的生活。
  * God also calls his people, the Church, to go out and teach the good message about Jesus.
  * 神也呼召属他的人(教会)出去，教导关于耶稣的福音。
