====== John (the Baptist)約翰（施洗者） ======

約翰（施洗者）

===== Facts: =====

實情：

John was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Since "John" was a common name, he is often called "John the Baptist" to distinguish him from the other people named John, such as the Apostle John.

約翰是撒迦利亞和伊麗莎白所生的兒子。由於“約翰”是一個普遍都在使用的名字，為了要與其他的也叫約翰的人有所區別，如使徒約翰，所以他就常被稱為“施洗者約翰”。

  * John was the prophet whom God sent to prepare people to believe in and follow the Messiah.

約翰是神派來的先知，為得是要預備人去相信和跟隨救世主（彌賽亞）。

  * John told people to confess their sins, turn to God, and stop sinning, so that they would be ready to receive the Messiah.
  * 約翰之所以呼籲世人要承認自己的罪，轉向神，停止犯罪，就是要叫他們預備好去領受救世主（彌賽亞）的救恩。
  * John baptized many people in water as a sign that they were sorry for their sins and were turning away from them.
  * 約翰在河水中給許多人所施行的洗禮，有如行了一個神蹟ㄧ樣，叫他們為自己的罪悔悟同時要離棄他們。
  * John was called, "John the Baptist" because he baptized many people.
  * 約翰之所以被稱為“施洗者約翰”是因為他曾經給許多人施洗。
  * Make sure that people will understand that "the Baptist" does not refer to the church by this name. It may be necessary to say instead, "John the Baptizer" or, "John who baptizes."
  * 大家務必要弄清楚，所謂“施洗者”這個名稱並不是指浸信會教會說的。為免混淆，必要時，可改稱“施洗者約翰”或，“施洗的約翰”等名稱來代替。
