====== John (the Baptist) 约翰（施洗者）F ======

===== Facts: =====

事实 ：

John was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Since "John" was a common name, he is often called "John the Baptist" to distinguish him from the other people named John, such as the Apostle John.

约翰是撒迦利亚和以利沙伯所生的儿子。 由于“约翰”是常用的名字，为了要与其他的也叫约翰的人有所区别，如使徒约翰，所以他就常被称为“施洗约翰”。

  * John was the prophet whom God sent to prepare people to believe in and follow the Messiah.
  * 约翰是神所派来的先知，为要预备人来相信和跟随弥赛亚。
  * John told people to confess their sins, turn to God, and stop sinning, so that they would be ready to receive the Messiah.
  * 约翰告诉百姓要承认自己的罪，转向神，停止犯罪，使他们可以预备好来接受弥赛亚。
  * John baptized many people in water as a sign that they were sorry for their sins and were turning away from them.
  * 约翰在水里给许多人施洗，作为他们悔悟自己的罪同时离弃这些罪的记号。
  * John was called, "John the Baptist" because he baptized many people.
  * 约翰之所以被称为“施洗约翰”是因为他曾经给许多人施洗。
  * Make sure that people will understand that "the Baptist" does not refer to the church by this name. It may be necessary to say instead, "John the Baptizer" or, "John who baptizes."
  * 务必使人知道，所谓“施洗者”这个名称并不是指用这个名称的教会说的。 为免混淆，必要时，可以改称“施洗约翰”或“施洗的约翰”。
