  * John was the prophet whom God sent to prepare people to believe in and follow the Messiah.
  * John told people to confess their sins, turn to God, and stop sinning, so that they would be ready to receive the Messiah.
  * John baptized many people in water as a sign that they were sorry for their sins and were turning away from them.
  * John was called, "John the Baptist" because he baptized many people.
