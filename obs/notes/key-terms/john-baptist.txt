====== John (the Baptist) ======

約翰（施洗者）

===== Facts: =====

實情：

John was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Since "John" was a common name, he is often called "John the Baptist" to distinguish him from the other people named John, such as the Apostle John.

約翰是撒迦利亞和伊麗莎白所生的兒子。由於“約翰”是一個共同使用的名字，他通常被稱為“施洗者約翰”以與其他人也名叫約翰的有所區別，如使徒約翰。

  * John was the prophet whom God sent to prepare people to believe in and follow the Messiah.

約翰是神派來預備的人去相信和跟隨救世主（彌賽亞）的先知。

  * John told people to confess their sins, turn to God, and stop sinning, so that they would be ready to receive the Messiah.
  * 約翰之所以呼籲世人要承認自己的罪，轉向神，停止犯罪，就是要為了讓他們預備好領受救世主（彌賽亞）的救贖。
  * John baptized many people in water as a sign that they were sorry for their sins and were turning away from them.
  * 約翰在水中給許多人所施行的洗好像行了一個神蹟使他們都為他們自己的罪惡感到難過，並且要離棄他們。
  * John was called, "John the Baptist" because he baptized many people.
  * 約翰之所以被稱為“施洗者約翰”是因為他曾給許多人施洗。
  * Make sure that people will understand that "the Baptist" does not refer to the church by this name. It may be necessary to say instead, "John the Baptizer" or, "John who baptizes."
  * 大家要確實明白 “施洗者”並不是指教會的名字。它可能有必要用來代替，“施洗者約翰”或，“約翰施洗”說的。
