====== Baal 巴力 ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

巴力是一个假神的名字，被在迦南地几个族群部落拜为神。

  * The name "Baal" means "lord." The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the true Lord.
  * “巴力”，这个名字的意思是“主”。敬拜巴力就是直接挑战耶和华 - 这唯一真神的权柄。
  * The Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
  * 以色列人也因着敬拜巴力而犯了罪。
  * There were 450 prophets of Baal in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab. The prophet Elijah set up a test for the prophets of Baal and proved that their god does not exist. As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and worshiped only Yahweh for a period of time.
  * 在亚哈王统治时期的以色列北部王国，有450个巴力的先知。先知以利亚为巴力的先知们设置了一次考验，证明了他们的神并不存在。于是，人们杀了巴力的这些先知们，只敬拜耶和华达很长时间。
