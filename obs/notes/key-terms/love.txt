===== Definition: =====

定义 :

To love someone is to want to protect, care for, and be with that person.

爱一个人就是要保护，照顾，并与那人在一起。

  * To love someone is to have affection for him and to be devoted and committed to him and to what is good for him.
  * 爱一个人是对他有感情，投入并专注于他和对他好的事。
  * Love is much deeper than "to like" or a mere emotion. Jesus loved us by sacrificing everything, including his life, in order to rescue us from sin and death.
  * 爱是比“ 喜欢” 或仅仅的情感深得多。 耶稣爱我们，他牺牲了一切，包括他的生命，为了从罪和死亡里拯救我们。
  * Jesus said that the greatest love is to sacrifice yourself for someone else.
  * 耶稣说，最大的爱就是为别人牺牲自己。
  * These are ways some languages talk about loving someone: "He put him in his heart" or, "His thoughts were towards him" or, "He feels good-heart toward him."
  * 有些不同的说法可以讲到爱一个人：“他把某人放在他的心上”，或“他的想法是向着某人”，或者“他对某人的感觉很好”。
  * While love is usually a strong commitment to a person, it can also be commitment to an ideal such as truth or justice.
  * 虽然爱情通常是对人的一个坚定的承诺，但是这承诺也可以是对一个理想，如真理或公义。
  * In other cases when people say they love something, they simply mean they like it very much. For example, someone could say, "I love good food."
  * 在其它的例子, 当人们说他们爱什么东西，他们只是说他们非常喜欢它。例如，有人可能会说：“我爱好吃的食物。”
