====== Isaac以撒 ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

Isaac was the son that God promised to give Abraham and Sarah even though they were very old.

以撒是神应许给亚伯拉罕和撒拉的儿子，尽管那时他们都已年迈。

  * God promised that the covenant that he had made with Abraham would extend to Isaac and to all of Isaac's descendants forever.
  * 神应许，他和亚伯拉罕立的约将延伸到以撒和以撒的所有的后代，永永远远。
  * God tested Abraham's faith by telling him to sacrifice Isaac.
  * 神通过用让亚伯拉罕去祭祀以撒的办法，测试亚伯拉罕的忠心。
  * Isaac's son Jacob had twelve sons. Their descendants later became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.
  * 以撒的儿子雅各有十二个儿子。他们的后裔后来成为以色列民族的十二个支派。
  * Isaac means "he laughs." When God told Abraham that he and Sarah would have a child, he laughed because they were both very old.
  * 以撒名字的意思是“他笑”。当神告诉亚伯拉罕，他和撒拉将有个孩子时，亚伯拉罕一笑，因为他们夫妻俩都已经很老了。
