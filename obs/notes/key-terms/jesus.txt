耶穌

===== Facts: =====

實情：

Jesus is the Son of God. The name "Jesus" means, "Yahweh will save." Therefore, the name "Jesus" emphasizes that God's Son became a man in order to save people from their sins.

耶穌是神的兒子。“耶穌”這個名字的意思是指“雅威必将拯救” 。因此，起名“耶穌”的目的是要強調，神的兒子成为人子，是要把世人從他们的罪中拯救出來。

  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to take on human form. Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is a human being. But Jesus already existed as God when he was miraculously conceived in Mary's body. Therefore, he is both fully God and fully human.
  * 聖靈藉著神蹟使神永生的兒子呈现出人的样式。因為耶穌的生母是世人，所以他就成为一個真實的人。但當耶穌奇蹟般地在瑪麗亞的身體裡孕育時，他就已经作为神存在了。因此，他既是完全的神也是完全的人。
  * Jesus lived a perfect life. He obeyed his parents, obeyed God, and never sinned.
  * 耶穌在地上過著完美的生活。他孝顺他的父母，順從神，從未犯過罪。
  * Jesus taught people about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶穌教導世人有關神國的事情。
  * Jesus healed many people, made demons leave people, and did many other miraculous things. This helped to prove that his teaching was from God and that it was true.
  * 耶穌曾經醫治了許多人，让邪靈離開人，行了很多其他的神蹟奇事。這都有助於證明他的教導是從神而來，並且都是真實的。
  * Though Jesus never sinned, he was killed as a criminal and took the punishment for people's sins.
  * 雖然耶穌從未犯過罪，但他還是被當作一名罪犯而遭到殺害，他为着人的罪而受罚。
  * Three days after he died, Jesus came to life again and taught people more about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶穌死後三天，他又復活了，接着教導世人更多有關神國的事情。
  * Then Jesus returned to heaven and now rules with his Father. He is also our great high priest, who speaks to the Father in our favor.
  * 然後耶穌就回到天国，現在正在與父神一起掌管（万民）。他也是我們最偉大的大祭司，为我们的蒙恩向父神求告。
  * Jesus is the Messiah. Someday he will return and will reign as king over all the earth.
  * 耶穌就是彌賽亞。某一天他必将归来，作为君王來统领全地。
