====== Jesus 耶穌 L ======

===== Facts: =====

实情 ：

Jesus is the Son of God. The name "Jesus" means, "Yahweh will save." Therefore, the name "Jesus" emphasizes that God's Son became a man in order to save people from their sins.

耶稣是神的儿子。 “耶稣”这个名字的意思是指“耶和华将拯救” 。 因此，起名“耶稣”的目的是要强调，神的儿子成为人，是要把世人从他们的罪中拯救出来。

  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to take on human form. Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is a human being. But Jesus already existed as God when he was miraculously conceived in Mary's body. Therefore, he is both fully God and fully human.圣灵借着神迹使神永生的儿子取了人的样式。 因为耶稣是从人类的母亲出生，所以他是一个完全的人。 但当耶稣奇迹般地在马利亚的身体里孕育时，他已是神。 因此，他既是完全的神也是完全的人。
  * Jesus lived a perfect life. He obeyed his parents, obeyed God, and never sinned.
  * 耶稣在地上过着完全的生活。 他孝顺父母，顺从神，从未犯过罪。

  * Though Jesus never sinned, he was killed as a criminal and took the punishment for people's sins.
  * 虽然耶稣从未犯过罪，但祂还是被当作一名罪犯而遭到杀害，为着世人的罪而受罚。
  * Three days after he died, Jesus came to life again and taught people more about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶稣死后三天，祂又复活了，并教导世人更多有关神国的事。
  * Then Jesus returned to heaven and now rules with his Father. He is also our great high priest, who speaks to the Father in our favor.
  * 然后耶稣就回到天堂，现在正在与父神一起掌权。祂 也是我们最伟大的大祭司，为我们向父神代求。
