耶穌

===== Facts: =====

實情：

Jesus is the Son of God. The name "Jesus" means, "Yahweh will save." Therefore, the name "Jesus" emphasizes that God's Son became a man in order to save people from their sins.

耶穌是神的兒子。“耶穌”這名字的意思就是“耶和華必拯救.” 。因此，取這個名字“耶穌”的目的是要強調神的兒子來做人是為了要把人從他們的罪惡中拯救出來。

  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to take on human form. Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is a human being. But Jesus already existed as God when he was miraculously conceived in Mary's body. Therefore, he is both fully God and fully human.
  * 聖靈藉著神蹟使永生神的兒子成了肉身的形狀。因為耶穌是由人的母親生的，他就是一個真實的人。但是，當耶穌奇蹟般地孕育在瑪麗亞的身體裡時，耶穌已經像神一樣地存在她的體內了。因此，他即是完全的神也是完全的人。
  * Jesus lived a perfect life. He obeyed his parents, obeyed God, and never sinned.
  * 耶穌在地上過著一個無瑕無疵的生活。他聽從他的父母，順從神，從來沒有犯過罪。
  * Jesus taught people about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶穌教導老百姓有關神的國度的事情。
  * Jesus healed many people, made demons leave people, and did many other miraculous things. This helped to prove that his teaching was from God and that it was true.
  * 耶穌曾經醫好了許多人，又去吩咐邪靈離開人，更行了不少其他的神蹟。這些事蹟都有助於證明他的教誨確是從神而來而且都是真實的。
  * Though Jesus never sinned, he was killed as a criminal and took the punishment for people's sins.
  * 雖然耶穌從未犯過罪，但是他還是被當作一名罪犯遭到殺害，而且他還為了人的罪惡代替他們去承受刑罰。
  * Three days after he died, Jesus came to life again and taught people more about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶穌死後第三天，當他復活了之後就去教導人們更多有關神的國度的事情。
  * Then Jesus returned to heaven and now rules with his Father. He is also our great high priest, who speaks to the Father in our favor.
  * 然後耶穌就回到天上去了，現在正在天上與神一起統管天下。但是當他還在地上時，他則是我們最偉大的大祭司，經常為我們的益處求告神。
  * Jesus is the Messiah. Someday he will return and will reign as king over all the earth.
  * 耶穌就是那位救世主（彌賽亞）。將來有一天他必會回到地上來以君王的身分來統治全地。
