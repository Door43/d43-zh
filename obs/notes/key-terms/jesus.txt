耶穌

===== Facts: =====

實情：

Jesus is the Son of God. The name "Jesus" means, "Yahweh will save." Therefore, the name "Jesus" emphasizes that God's Son became a man in order to save people from their sins.

耶穌是神的兒子。取名叫“耶穌”的意思就是指“耶和華必拯救.”的意思 。因此，取名叫“耶穌”的目的是要強調，神的兒子來做人，是為了要把世人從自己的罪惡中拯救出來的意思。

  * In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to take on human form. Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is a human being. But Jesus already existed as God when he was miraculously conceived in Mary's body. Therefore, he is both fully God and fully human.
  * 聖靈曾經藉著神蹟使神在天上的永恆的兒子來到地上取了肉身的形狀來做人。因為，耶穌是由人的母親生的，他就是一個真實的人。但是，當耶穌奇蹟般地孕育在瑪麗亞的身體裡時，耶穌早已經是自有永有的神了。因此，他即是完全的神也是完全的人。
  * Jesus lived a perfect life. He obeyed his parents, obeyed God, and never sinned.
  * 耶穌在地上過著一個無瑕無疵的生活。因為他聽從他的父母，順從神，從來沒有犯過罪。
  * Jesus taught people about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶穌還教導世人有關神的國度的事情。
  * Jesus healed many people, made demons leave people, and did many other miraculous things. This helped to prove that his teaching was from God and that it was true.
  * 耶穌曾經醫治了許多人，又去吩咐邪靈離開人，更行了不少其他的神蹟奇事。這些事蹟都有助於證明他的教誨確是從神而來，並且都是真實的。
  * Though Jesus never sinned, he was killed as a criminal and took the punishment for people's sins.
  * 雖然耶穌從未犯過罪，但是他還是被當作一名罪犯來遭到殺害，並且承受了因人的罪所帶來的刑罰。
  * Three days after he died, Jesus came to life again and taught people more about the kingdom of God.
  * 耶穌死後過了三天，當他復活了之後就去教導世人更多有關神的國度的事情。
  * Then Jesus returned to heaven and now rules with his Father. He is also our great high priest, who speaks to the Father in our favor.
  * 然後耶穌就回到天上去了，現在正在天上與神一起統管天下。但是他仍是我們最偉大的大祭司，因為他一直在天上為我們的益處在神的面前不住地求告神。
  * Jesus is the Messiah. Someday he will return and will reign as king over all the earth.
  * 耶穌就是那位救世主（彌賽亞）。將來有一天他必會回到地上來以君王的身分來統治全地。
