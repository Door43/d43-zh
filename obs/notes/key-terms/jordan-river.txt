====== Jordan River约旦河 ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

The Jordan River is a river that flows from north to south, and forms the eastern boundary of the land that was called Canaan.

约旦河，是一条从北向南流向的河；它形成了迦南地的东部边界。

  * Today, the Jordan River separates Israel on the west from Jordan on the east.
  * 今天，约旦河把西边的以色列和东边的约旦隔开。
  * The Jordan River flows through the Sea of Galilee and then empties into the Dead Sea.
  * 约旦河流经加利利海，然后汇入死海。
  * When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, they had to cross the Jordan River while it was flooding and very deep. Because it was too deep to wade across, God miraculously stopped the water from flowing so they could go across.
  * 当约书亚带领以色列人进入迦南时，在约旦河洪水泛滥而且（水流）很深的时候，他们跨过了约旦河。因为河水太深了，不能趟水过河，神行神迹使河水停止流动，这样他们就能走过去了。
