（祭祀，供奉）

===== Definition: =====

定义：

A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form of worship.

祭祀是对神供奉某些贵重物品，作为敬拜的一种形式。

  * The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank him for blessings.
  * 以色列人做不同形式的祭祀，包括祈求神要饶恕他们的罪，和感恩神的赐福。
  * Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.
  * 很多祭祀都要宰杀一只动物，并把它作为礼物供奉给神。

Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin. Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse people from sin.

动物祭祀不会真正地使人洁净他的罪。
