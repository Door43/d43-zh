定义

After Jesus went back to heaven, people started calling his followers "Christians" because they were followers of Christ, which is another word for "Messiah."

在耶稣回到天国后,人们开始称呼他的追随者为基督徒.他们是耶稣基督亦称弥赛亚的追随者.

  * A Christian is a person who follows Jesus. He believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and he trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
  * 基督徒就是追随耶稣并且相信他是神的儿子,同时相信耶稣从罪里拯救人.
  * People sometimes use the word "Christian" to refer to someone who just believes that the Christian religion is a good religion. This is not the meaning of "Christian" in the Bible.
  * 人们有时用"基督徒"表示基督教是一门好的宗教,但这不是圣经中"基督徒 "的定义。
  * In the Bible, "Christian" always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus. For that reason, "Christians" are often called "believers."
  * 圣经中“基督徒”的定义是真正相信耶稣的人，因此，基督徒又常被称为“相信者”。
  * Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.
  * 在翻译这些词时要谨慎，基督徒是指任何相信主耶稣的人，而不仅仅是一些群体。
