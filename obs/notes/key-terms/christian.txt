定义

After Jesus went back to heaven, people started calling his followers "Christians" because they were followers of Christ, which is another word for "Messiah."

在耶稣回到天上以后,人们开始称呼他的追随者为「基督徒」,因为他们是基督，也就是「弥赛亚」的追随者.

  * A Christian is a person who follows Jesus. He believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and he trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
  * 基督徒是追随耶稣的人,他相信耶稣是神的儿子,同时也相信耶稣会把他从他的罪里拯救出来.
  * People sometimes use the word "Christian" to refer to someone who just believes that the Christian religion is a good religion. This is not the meaning of "Christian" in the Bible.
  * 人们有时用"基督徒"一词,指那些仅仅相信基督教是一门好宗教的人,但这不是圣经中"基督徒 "的 意思。
  * In the Bible, "Christian" always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus. For that reason, "Christians" are often called "believers."
  * 圣经中“基督徒”一直是指那些真正相信耶稣的人，因此，基督徒又常被称为“信徒”。
  * Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.
  * 在翻译这个词时要谨慎，基督徒是指每一个相信耶稣的人，而不仅仅是一些群体。
