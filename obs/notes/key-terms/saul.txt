====== Saul扫罗 ======

===== Facts: =====

事迹实例：

Saul was an Israelite man whom God chose to become the first king of Israel.

扫罗是个以色列人，神拣选了他成为以色列的第一个王。

  * Saul was tall and handsome, and a powerful soldier. He was the kind of person that the Israelites wanted to be their king.
  * 扫罗高大且英俊（俊美），还是个英勇的士兵。他正是以色列人想要的人来做他们的王。
  * Although he served God at first, he later became proud and disobeyed God. As a result, God appointed David to take Saul's place as king.
  * 尽管他一开始服侍神，后来他变得骄傲了，悖逆了神。结果是，神指派了大卫替代了扫罗做了王。

Hundreds of years later, there was another Jew named Saul, but his name was changed to Paul after he came to know Jesus.

几百年以后，有另外一个犹太人叫扫罗，但是在他认识了耶稣后他的名字改成了保罗。
