====== Saul扫罗 W ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

Saul was an Israelite man whom God chose to become the first king of Israel.

扫罗是个以色列人，神拣选了他成为以色列的第一个王。

  * Saul was tall and handsome, and a powerful soldier. He was the kind of person that the Israelites wanted to be their king.
  * 扫罗高大且英俊（俊美），还是个大能的勇士。他正是以色列人想要来做他们的王的那种人。
  * Although he served God at first, he later became proud and disobeyed God. As a result, God appointed David to take Saul's place as king.
  * 尽管他一开始服侍神，后来他变得骄傲，悖逆神。结果是，神择选了大卫替代了扫罗做王。

Hundreds of years later, there was another Jew named Saul, but his name was changed to Paul after he came to know Jesus.

几百年以后，有另外一个犹太人叫扫罗，但是在他认识耶稣后他的名字改成了保罗。

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:17-01|[17-01]]]****Saul**  was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. **Saul**  was a good king for the first few years that he ruled over Israel. But then he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man who would one day be king in his place.

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:17-05|[17-05]]]** Eventually, **Saul**  died in battle, and David became king of Israel.
  * 最终，扫罗战死沙场，大卫成了以色列的王。
