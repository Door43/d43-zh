====== tax collector 税吏W ======

===== Definition: =====

定义：

The job of tax collectors was to receive the money that people owed the government and to deliver it to the government.

税吏的工作是征收百姓欠政府的钱，再把钱交给政府。

  * In the time of Jesus and and the apostles, the Roman government required taxes from the Jews.
  * 在耶稣和使徒的时代，罗马政府向犹太人征税。
  * The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
  * 为罗马政府收税的人通常要求百姓交纳比政府所要求的更多的钱。税吏们会把额外的数额留给他们自己。
  * The Jews considered tax collectors to be some of the worst sinners because they cheated people, and because they worked for the foreign Roman government. This made the tax collectors traitors to their own people.
  * 犹太人认为税吏是最坏的罪人之一，因为他们欺骗百姓，且因为他们是为非犹太的罗马政府工作。这使得税吏们成为他们自己的百姓中的叛徒。

圣经故事例证：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-06|[34-06]]]** He said, "Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a **tax collector**, and the other was a religious leader."
  * 他说，“有两个人到圣殿去祷告。其中的一个是税吏，而另一个是宗教首领。”
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-07|[34-07]]]**"The religious leader prayed like this, 'Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that **tax collector**.”
  * 宗教首领这样祷告说：”神，感谢你。我不象其他罪人，就如强盗，不义的人，犯奸淫的人，也不象这个税吏”。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-09|[34-09]]]**"But the **tax collector**  stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, 'God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.“
  * “但是那税吏离宗教首领远远地站着，他甚至都不敢举目望天。相反，他捶着胸，祷告说：”神啊，请怜悯我，因为我是个罪人。“
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-10|[34-10]]]** Then Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, God heard the **tax collector's**  prayer and declared him to be righteous."
