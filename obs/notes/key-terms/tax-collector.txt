====== tax collector 税吏 ======

===== Definition: =====

定义：

The job of tax collectors was to receive the money that people owed the government and to deliver it to the government.

税吏的工作是征收人们欠政府的钱，并把钱交给政府。

  * In the time of Jesus and and the apostles, the Roman government required taxes from the Jews.
  * 在耶稣和使徒时代，罗马政府向犹太人征税。
  * The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
  * 向罗马政府交税的人通常从人们征收比政府所要求的更多的钱。税吏们会把额外的数额留给他们自己。
  * The Jews considered tax collectors to be some of the worst sinners because they cheated people, and because they worked for the foreign Roman government. This made the tax collectors traitors to their own people.
  * 犹太人认为税吏是最坏的罪人，因为他们欺骗人，而且他们是为外国的罗马政府工作。这使得税吏们背叛了他们自己的人民。

圣经故事里的例子：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-06|[34-06]]]** He said, "Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a **tax collector**, and the other was a religious leader."
  * 他说，“两个人到祭坛去祷告。他们中的一个是税吏，另一个是宗教领袖。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-07|[34-07]]]**"The religious leader prayed like this, 'Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that **tax collector**.”
  * 宗教领袖这样祷告到，”谢谢你，神，我不是一个象其他人一样的罪人 —— 如强盗，不义的人，奸淫者，或象税吏这样的人”。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-09|[34-09]]]**"But the **tax collector**  stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, 'God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.“
  * “但是税吏和这个宗教领袖就差太远了，他甚至都不抬头望向天空，相反，他拍着自己的胸脯，”神啊，请怜悯我吧，因为我是个罪人。“
