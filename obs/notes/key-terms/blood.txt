====== blood 血/血液 ======

===== Definition: =====

定义：

Blood is the red liquid in our bodies that can flow out when we are injured.

血是在人受伤时，从我们身体里会流出来的红色液体。

  * People and animals need the blood in their bodies in order to live. So blood is often a symbol of life.
  * 人和动物的身体中需要有血液，才能活着。所以血液通常是一个生命的符号。
  * But blood can also be a symbol of death since if too much blood comes out (because of being injured or sick), that person or animal will die.
  * 但是血液也可以是死亡的符号，因为如果流出的血液太多了（因为受伤或病了），人或动物将会死亡。
  * When people made sacrifices to God, they killed an animal and poured its blood on the altar. God told them to kill the animal in their place so they would not have to be killed as punishment for their sins.
  * 在人们向神献祭时，他们（先）杀了一个动物，把它们的血浇在祭坛上。神告诉他们杀了这动物，取而代之人，这样人就不会因着他们的罪作为惩罚而被杀。
  * Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice. His blood symbolically covers our sins and cleanses us from them.
  * 耶稣作为完美的祭祀而死。他的血象征性地遮盖了我们的罪，并从罪中洁净了我们。
