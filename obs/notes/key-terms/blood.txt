===== Definition: =====

定义：

Blood is the red liquid in our bodies that can flow out when we are injured.

血是我们的受伤的身体中会流出的的红色的液体。

  * People and animals need the blood in their bodies in order to live. So blood is often a symbol of life.
  * 人和动物的身体中需要血液来活着。所以血液经常是一个生命的符号。
  * But blood can also be a symbol of death since if too much blood comes out (because of being injured or sick), that person or animal will die.
  * 但是血液也可以是死亡的符号，因为如果太多的血液流出（比如因为受伤或病了），人或动物将会死亡。
  * When people made sacrifices to God, they killed an animal and poured its blood on the altar. God told them to kill the animal in their place so they would not have to be killed as punishment for their sins.
  * 当人们向神祭祀时，他们杀了一个动物，把它们的血浇在祭坛上。神告诉他们在有动物的地方杀这动物，这样它们就不会因着它们的罪作为惩罚而被杀。
  * Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice. His blood symbolically covers our sins and cleanses us from them.
  * 耶稣完美地牺牲而死。他的雪象征性地掩盖了我们的罪，并从中洁净了我们。
