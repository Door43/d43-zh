  * 他们非常骄傲，并不在乎神所说的。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-10|[34-10]]]** Then Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector's prayer and declared him to be righteous. But he did not like the prayer of the religious leader. God will humble everyone who is **proud**, and he will lift up whoever humbles himself."
  * 于是，耶稣说，“我实在地告诉你，神听到了税吏的祷告，宣布他为义人。但是他不喜欢那个宗教领袖的祷告。神将使骄傲之人谦卑，并鼓励表彰任何一个本身谦卑的人。
