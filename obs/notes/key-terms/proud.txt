  * 他们非常骄傲，并不在乎神所说的。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:34-10|[34-10]]]** Then Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector's prayer and declared him to be righteous. But he did not like the prayer of the religious leader. God will humble everyone who is **proud**, and he will lift up whoever humbles himself."
  * 于是，耶稣说，“我实在地告诉你们，神听了税吏的祷告，并称他为义人。但是神不喜欢那个宗教领袖的祷告。神要叫骄傲之人降卑，使自已降卑的人升高。
