====== obey服从/顺从 ======

===== Definition: =====

定义：

To obey is to follow the law or to do what someone in authority commands.

服从就是遵循法律，或做权威人士所命令的事。

  * When the law or someone in authority commands people to do something, they obey by doing it.
  * 当法律或权威人士命令人们去做某事时，人们遵命而为之。
  * When the law or someone in authority commands people not to do something, they obey by not doing it.
  * 当法律或权威人士命令人们不要去做某事时，人们遵命而不为之。

The only person who completely obeyed God was Jesus Christ, and him alone. The opposite of "obey" is "disobey."

完全顺从神的唯一的人是耶稣基督，仅他而已。“服从”的反义词是“背叛/悖逆”。
