====== obey服从/顺从 ======

===== Definition: =====

定义：

To obey is to follow the law or to do what someone in authority commands.

服从就是遵从律法，或做官方里的人命令的事。

  * When the law or someone in authority commands people to do something, they obey by doing it.
  * 当法律或官方的人命令人们去做某事的时候，人们服从地去做。
  * When the law or someone in authority commands people not to do something, they obey by not doing it.
  * 当法律或官方的人命令人们不要去做某事的时候，人们服从地不要去做。

The only person who completely obeyed God was Jesus Christ, and him alone. The opposite of "obey" is "disobey."

完全顺从神的唯一的人是耶稣基督，仅他而已。“服从”的反义词词是“背叛/悖逆”。
