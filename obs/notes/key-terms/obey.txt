  * When the law or someone in authority commands people to do something, they obey by doing it.
  * 当律法或掌权者命令人们去做某事时，人们照着去做就是顺服。
  * When the law or someone in authority commands people not to do something, they obey by not doing it.
  * 当律法或掌权者命令人们不要做某事时，人们不去做就是顺服。
  * <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The only person who completely obeyed God was Jesus Christ, and him alone. The opposite of "obey" is "disobey."</font>
  * 唯一完全顺服神的人只有耶稣基督，仅他而已。“顺服”的反义词是“悖逆”。
