===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

Solomon was the son of King David; his mother was Bathsheba.

所罗门是大卫王的儿子；他的母亲是拔士巴。

  * 当所罗门成为王时，神告诉他去要他想要的东西。所以所罗门请求要智慧，来公正地很好地统治管理他的人民。
  * Solomon built the Temple for God in Jerusalem that his father, David, had planned to build.
  * 所罗门为神在耶路撒冷建造了神殿，既他的父亲大卫曾经计划要建造的。
  * Although Solomon ruled wisely in the beginning years of his reign, later on he foolishly married many foreign women and started worshiping their gods.
  * 尽管所罗门在他在位的开始几年也明智地统治着，但后来他愚蠢地娶了很多外邦女子，并开始拜她们的神。
  * Because of Solomon's unfaithfulness, after his death, God divided the Israelites into two kingdoms that often fought against each other.
  * 因为所罗门的不忠，他死后，神把以色列人分裂在两个国里，这两个国（后来）互相攻打。
