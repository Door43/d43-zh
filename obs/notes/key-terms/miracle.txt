===== Definition: =====

定义：

Miracles are things that could never happen unless God caused them. For example, it was a miracle when God brought a dead person back to life.

神迹是那些从不可能发生的事情，除非神使然。例如，神使人死而复活就是一个神迹。

  * Miracles are sometimes called "wonders" because people are amazed by them. They are also called "signs" because they show that God is working through them.
  * 神迹有时被称作“奇迹”，因为奇迹使人惊奇。神迹也可以被称作“兆头”，因为它们显明神通过兆头在做工。
  * Since miracles are done by the power of God, they are sometimes called, "works of power."
  * 因为神迹是由神的大能完成的，神迹有时也被叫做，”能力的工作”。
  * People do not have the power to do miracles on their own. However, God has given different people the power to do miracles on many occasions to accomplish his purposes.
  * 人是不能凭自己的能力去行神迹的。然而，神赐给不同的人能力，在很多场所行神迹，来完成神的旨意。
  * For example, the prophets asked God to heal people, to provide food from nothing, and even to raise people from the dead, and God did those things.
  * 例如，先知们求神来医治病人，从一无所有中预备食物，甚至让死人复活，神做到了这些事情。
