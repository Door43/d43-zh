===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

圣经故事里的一些例子：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:20-02|[20-02]]]**] So God punished both kingdoms by allowing their enemies to destroy them. The kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the **Assyrian Empire**, a powerful, cruel nation. The **Assyrians**  killed many people in the kingdom of Israel, took away everything of value, and burned much of the country.
  * 所以神惩罚了这两个国，通过使两国的人互相争战来摧毁他们的国家。以色列国被强大的残忍的亚述帝国摧毁。亚述人杀了以色列国的很多人，夺走一切有价值的东西，烧毁了该国的大部分（城池）。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:20-03|[20-03]]]** The **Assyrians**  gathered all the leaders, the rich people, and the people with skills and took them to **Assyria**.
  * 亚述人将所有的领袖，有钱人和有技能的人全部聚集起来，把他们带到了亚述。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:20-04|[20-04]]]** Then the **Assyrians**  brought foreigners to live in the land where the kingdom of Israel had been.
  * 然后，亚述人把外邦人带进来，生活在曾经是以色列国的国土上。
