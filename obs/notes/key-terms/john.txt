聖經故事裡的例子：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:36-01|[36-01]]]** One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and **John**  with him. (The disciple named **John**  was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves.
  * 有一天，耶穌帶著他的三個門徒，彼得，雅各和約翰，上山去（起名叫約翰的門徒與那個為耶穌施洗的不是同一個人）。他們靠著自己爬上一座高山上。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:44-01|[44-01]]]** One day, Peter and **John**  were going to the Temple. As they approached the Temple gate, they saw a crippled man who was begging for money.
  * 又有一天，彼得和約翰到聖殿去。當他們來到聖殿的大門時，他們看見一個瘸子在向人乞討要錢。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:44-06|[44-06]]]** The leaders of the Temple were very upset by what Peter and **John**  were saying. So they arrested them and put them into prison.
  * 聖殿裡的首領們對彼得和約翰所說的話很生氣。於是他們就逮捕了他們，把他們關進監獄裡。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:44-07|[44-07]]]** The next day, the Jewish leaders brought Peter and **John**  to the high priest and the other religious leaders. They asked Peter and **John**, "By what power did you heal this crippled man?"
  * 第二天，猶太領袖們便把彼得和約翰一起帶到大祭司和其他的宗教領袖那裡受審問。他們審問彼得和約翰說，“你們憑甚麼能力把這個瘸子醫治好？”
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:44-09|[44-09]]]** The leaders were shocked that Peter and **John**  spoke so boldly because they could see that these men were ordinary men who were uneducated. But then they remembered that these men had been with Jesus. After they threatened Peter and **John**, they let them go.
  * 這些首領們對彼得和約翰說得如此大膽都感到震驚，因為他們看見這兩個人原是沒有學問的。後來他們才想起這兩個人是跟過耶穌的。於是他們先把他們恐嚇一番之後，便放了他們。
