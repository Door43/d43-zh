耶利米

===== Facts: =====

實情：

Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah.

耶利米是一位住在猶大王國裡的神的先知。

  * Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people that God was going to punish them for their sins.
  * 像大多數先知一樣，耶利米也經常警告世人，神會懲罰他們的罪。
  * Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a dry well and left him there to die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
  * 耶利米所說的有關迦勒底人將會攻佔耶路撒冷的預言，惹怒了許多猶大人。於是他們就把他關在一個枯井裡去等死。但是猶大王卻派了幾個僕人去把耶利米從井裡給救出來。

聖經故事裡的例子：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:19-17|[19-17]]]** Once, the prophet **Jeremiah**  was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull **Jeremiah**  out of the well before he died.
  * 【19－17】有一次，先知耶利米被關在一個枯井裡等死，因為他是陷在井底下的淤泥中（有生命的危險）。但是當時的國王卻憐憫他，在他快要死之前，派了幾個僕人把耶利米從井裡拉上來。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet **Jeremiah**, God promised that he would make a New Covenant, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai.
  * 【21－05】神藉著先知耶利米，應許他（以色列家）要與他另立一個新的約，但是這個約並不像從前神在西乃山上與以色列所立的約。
