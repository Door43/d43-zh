耶利米

===== Facts: =====

實情：

Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah.

耶利米是住在猶大王國裡的一個神的先知。

  * Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people that God was going to punish them for their sins.
  * 像大多數先知一樣，耶利米也經常警告過世人說，神會懲罰他們的罪。
  * Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a dry well and left him there to die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
  * 耶利米所說的有關迦勒底人必會攻佔耶路撒冷的預言，惹怒了許多猶大人。於是他們把他關在一個乾枯的井裡等死。但是猶大王卻派了他的幾個僕人去把耶利米從井裡給救了出來。

聖經故事裡的例子：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:19-17|[19-17]]]** Once, the prophet **Jeremiah**  was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull **Jeremiah**  out of the well before he died.
  * 【19－17】有一次，先知耶利米曾經被關在一個乾枯的井裡等死，因為他是陷在井底下的爛泥中有生命的危險。但是當時國王憐憫他，並在他快要死之前，派了他的幾個僕人去把耶利米從井裡救起來。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet **Jeremiah**, God promised that he would make a New Covenant, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai.
  * 【21－05】神藉著先知耶利米，應許他要與他另立一個新約，但這個約並不像從前神在西乃山上與以色列所立的約。
