Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah.

耶利米是犹大国里神的先知。

  * 像大多数先知一样，耶利米经常警告世人，神会因他们的罪惩罚他们。
  * Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a dry well and left him there to die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
  * 因为耶利米预言说迦勒底人将会攻占耶路撒冷，惹怒了许多犹大人。 于是他们就把他关在一个枯井里等死。 但是犹大王却派了几个仆人去把耶利米从井里给救出来。
