==== (Jewish leaders, religious leaders) ====

（猶太領袖，宗教領袖）

===== Facts: =====

實情：

The Jewish leaders were religious leaders, such as priests and experts in God's laws.

猶太領袖就是宗教領袖，比如那些在神的律法下的祭司和律法師。

  * Many of the religious leaders did not believe that Jesus was the Messiah and Son of God. They were jealous of Jesus and did not want other people to believe in him either.
  * 有許多宗教領袖並不相信耶穌是救世主（彌賽亞）及神的兒子。他們自己不但忌妒耶穌還要其他的人也不要相信他。
  * Some of the religious leaders did believe in Jesus–especially after he rose from the dead.
  * 有一些宗教領袖確實相信耶穌－尤其是當他從死裡復活之後。
  * Many of the religious leaders believed that they were more righteous than other people, and they were too proud to admit their sins. They lied about Jesus to the Roman rulers and demanded that he be killed.
  * 許多宗教領袖自認為他們自己比其他的人更正義，而且他們都過於傲慢而不肯承認自己的罪。他們向羅馬統治者控告耶穌時說了謊，還要求把他殺了。
  * Jesus condemned the Jewish leaders for being hypocrites. They claimed to know God, but did not obey him.
  * 於是耶穌譴責那些猶太領袖都是一些假冒偽善的人。他們自稱認識神卻又不去服從他。
