===== Definition: =====

定义：

When someone inherits something, he or she receives something valuable from someone else because of a special relationship with that person.

当某人因着和另一人的一层特殊关系，从那人接受了某些有价值的东西时，这就产生了继承/传承。

  * **Inheritance from Family**  - After the death of a relative, sometimes family members receive money or property (items or land) that that relative owned before they died.
  * 从家族继承 - 在一个亲属去世后，有时家族的成员们就接受那亲属死前所拥有的钱财或地产（物品或土地）。
  * **Inheritance from God**  - God has promised to give certain things to his people. To the descendants of Abraham, he promised land. To those who trust in Jesus, he promised an inheritance of eternal (or everlasting) life with him in heaven.
  * 从神传承 - 神已应许把某些东西给他的子民。对于亚伯拉罕的后裔们来说，神应许了土地。对于信耶稣的那些人来说，他应许了一个和神在天国永生（或永恒）的传承。
