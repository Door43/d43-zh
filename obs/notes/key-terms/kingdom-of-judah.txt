（犹大国，犹大）

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

Judah was the largest of the twelve tribes of Israel. After King Solomon died, the Israelites split into two kingdoms: Israel and Judah. The kingdom of Judah was the southern kingdom, composed of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

犹大是以色列十二个支派中最大的一个支派。所罗门王死后，以色列人分裂成两个国：以色列国和犹大国。犹大国是南部的国，包括犹大和便雅悯两个支派。

  * The capital city of the kingdom of Judah was Jerusalem.
  * 犹大国的首府是耶路撒冷。
  * Some of the kings of the kingdom of Judah obeyed God and led the people to worship him. But many of Judah's kings were evil.
  * 一些犹大国的王们順服神，並带领百姓去敬拜神。但是犹大国的很多王是恶的。
  * Over 120 years after Assyria defeated Israel (the northern kingdom), Judah was conquered by the nation of Babylon. The Babylonians destroyed the city and the Temple, and took most of the people from the kingdom of Judah away to Babylon as captives.
  * 在亚述打败了以色列国（北国）后的120多年，犹大国被巴比伦国征服。巴比伦人摧毁了犹大城和圣殿，掳掠了犹大国的大部分人到巴比伦做俘虏。
