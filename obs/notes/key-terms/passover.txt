====== Passover逾越节 ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

This was a celebration that God wanted the Israelites to do each year in order to remember how God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites and did not kill their sons when he killed the firstborn sons of every Egyptian family.

这是个庆祝仪式，既神要以色列人每年举办一次，为的是让他们记住，当神杀了每个埃及人的家里的头生子时，神是如何“逾越”过以色列人的房屋而不杀他们的子孙的。

  * The Passover Feast, or celebration, includes a special meal that reminds people of the meal they ate that night. The meal included a lamb without any defect that they killed, roasted, and shared, as well as bread made without yeast.
