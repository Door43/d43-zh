死亡

==== (death, die, dying, dead) ====

死亡,死,將死,死的

===== Definition: =====

The term "death" is used in two different ways in the Bible. It sometimes refers to when the physical body of a person ceases to live. It is also used for the spiritual separation of sinners from a holy God.

聖經中提到死亡有兩種定義, 一種是說到我們肉體的死, 另一種是說到罪人與神隔離, 靈性上的死

=== 1. Physical death ===

肉體的死

  * To die is to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.
  * 死就是停止生命的活動, 死亡就是肉身生命的結束
  * A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.
  * 當一個人死了, 他的靈魂就離開他的身體
  * Physical death is the result of the sin of Adam and Eve.
  * 身體的死亡是亞當與夏娃犯罪的結果

=== 2. Spiritual death ===

靈性的死亡

  * Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.
  * 靈性的死亡就是人與神隔絕
  * Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.
  * 亞當背逆神的時侯他的靈就死了, 因此他感到羞恥,想要躲避神的面
  * Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.
  * 每一個亞當的後代都是罪人, 他們的靈都是死的. 當我們相信耶穌基督的時侯, 神就使我們的靈活過來

"Death" is the opposite of "life". In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death.

聖經裏死亡與生命相對. 肉身的死與生常用來與靈性的生與死做比較
