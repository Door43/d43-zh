A **priest**  would kill the animal and burn it on the altar. The blood of the animal that was sacrificed covered the person's sin and made that person clean in God's sight. God chose Moses' brother, Aaron, and Aaron's descendants to be his **priests**.
  * 凡是违背了神律法的人可带一只动物到会幕前面的祭坛，作为祭物献给神。祭司会把那动物杀了，并烧在祭坛上。被献的动物的血遮盖了那人的罪，使那人在神的眼中成为洁净。神拣选摩西的哥哥亚伦和亚伦的后代作他的祭司。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:19-07|[19-07]]]** So the **priests**  of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

  * 以色列祭司是为百姓献祭给神的人，来代替百姓所犯的罪的惩罚。祭司们也为百姓向神祷告。
