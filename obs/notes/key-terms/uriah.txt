  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:17-12|[17-12]]]** Bathsheba's husband, a man named **Uriah**, was one of David's best soldiers. David called **Uriah**  back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But **Uriah**  refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent **Uriah**  back to the battle and told the general to place him where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.
  * 拔士巴的丈夫名叫乌利亚，是大卫的最好的士兵之一。大卫把乌利亚从战场召回，告诉他去和他妻子团聚。但是乌利亚拒绝回家，而其他剩余的士兵还在战场上。所以大卫又把乌利亚派回战场，告诉将军把他派到敌军最强壮的地方去，这样他就会被杀死。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:17-13|[17-13]]]** After **Uriah**  was killed, David married Bathsheba.
