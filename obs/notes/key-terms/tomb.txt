==== (tomb, grave) （坟墓，墓穴） ====

===== Definition: =====

定义：

A tomb is a place where people put the bodies of those who die.

坟墓是人们埋葬死人遗体的地方。

  * The Jews sometimes used natural caves as tombs, and sometimes they dug caves out of the rock on the side of a hill.
  * 犹太人有时用天然洞穴作为坟墓，有时他们在山腰的石头间掘洞穴。
  * When Jesus was living, it was common to roll a large, heavy, round stone in front of the opening of a tomb in order to close it.
  * 在耶稣生活的时代，常有人把一块大又重的圆石头滚在坟墓的门口来封住它。
  * This can also be translated as, "grave." But if your word for grave can only refer to a hole dug down into the ground so that the body is placed below the ground, then it might be better to translate it as, "cave" or, "hole in a hill."
  * 这也可以被翻译作“墓穴”。但是如果你说的墓穴只是指地下挖出的一个洞，从而遗体被安放在地的下面，那最好把它翻作“洞穴”，或“山里的洞穴”。
