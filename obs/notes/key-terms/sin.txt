===== Definition: =====

定义：

Sin is anything that we do or say that is against what God wants.

罪是我们所做的或所说的违背了神的意愿。

  * When we disobey God's commands and desires we are sinning.
  * 当我们违背了神的命令和愿望时，我们就是在犯罪。
  * We can sin by active disobedience (rebellion), or by inaction (failing to do something that God wants us to do.)
  * 我们犯罪可以是积极的违背（背逆）， 或者是不作为（ 没有做神要我们做的事）。

Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit that God told them not to eat. Before that there was no sin in the world. Sin is passed from parent to child through the entire human race. God must punish sin.

亚当和夏娃是吃了神吩咐他们不可吃的果子而犯了罪。在那之前，世上本没有罪。罪在全人类当中通过父母传到子女。神必须惩罚罪。
