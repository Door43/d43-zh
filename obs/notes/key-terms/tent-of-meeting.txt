====== Tent of Meeting 会幕 W ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

When God gave his laws at Mount Sinai, he told the Israelites to make the Tent of Meeting. This was the holy place where he would meet with them. As they wandered through the wilderness, they would take it with them and set it up whenever God told them to do so.

当神在西乃山上颁布律法时，他吩咐以色列人建造会幕。这是他要与以色列人相会的圣地。当他们在旷野漂流时，他们会带着会幕，并在神吩咐的时候把它搭起来。

  * The Tent of Meeting was like a house made of cloth stretched over a wooden framework.
  * 会幕就象一个用布撑在一个木头框架上的房子。
  * God told the people to set up the Tent of Meeting in the middle of a large courtyard surrounded by walls made of cloth and wood.
  * 神吩咐百姓把会幕搭在一个用布和木头围成的院子当中。
  * God told them to put the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting in the middle of the courtyard. The people could go into the courtyard to give offerings and sacrifices to God. The priests who were on duty would receive what the people brought and then offer it on the altar for a sacrifice as the law required.
  * 神吩咐他们把祭坛安放在院子当中会幕的前面。百姓可以进到院子里去把幡祭和祭物献给神。当值的祭司们会收取百姓带来的东西，然后按律法的规定把它献在祭坛上作祭物。
  * The Tent of Meeting had a thick curtain hanging in the middle of it, which divided it into two rooms. The curtain was used as barrier to keep people from seeing the room on the other side, and to keep people from going into it. The first room was very holy, so only the priests could go into it. The second room was the most holy place, so only the high priest could go into it.
  * 有一块厚厚的幔子挂在会幕的中央，把会幕分成两个房间。这幔子是用来做屏障的，使百姓不能看到或进入另一侧的房间。第一个房间是圣所，所以只有祭司才能进去。第二个房间是至圣所，所以只有大祭司方能进入。
