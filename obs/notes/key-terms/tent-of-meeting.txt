====== Tent of Meeting 会幕 ======

===== Facts: =====

事实依据：

When God gave his laws at Mount Sinai, he told the Israelites to make the Tent of Meeting. This was the holy place where he would meet with them. As they wandered through the wilderness, they would take it with them and set it up whenever God told them to do so.

当神在西奈山给出他的律法时，他告诉以色列人去做个会议帐幕。这是他要会见以色列人的圣地。当他们经过旷野之地时，他们会把帐幕带上，并在神告诉他们挂的时候把它挂上。

  * The Tent of Meeting was like a house made of cloth stretched over a wooden framework.
  * 会幕像个房子一样，由布做成，撑开苫在一个木头框架上。
  * God told the people to set up the Tent of Meeting in the middle of a large courtyard surrounded by walls made of cloth and wood.
  * 神告诉人们在一个巨大的庭院的中间支起会幕，帐幕周围的墙被布和木头环绕着。
  * God told them to put the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting in the middle of the courtyard. The people could go into the courtyard to give offerings and sacrifices to God. The priests who were on duty would receive what the people brought and then offer it on the altar for a sacrifice as the law required.
  * 神告诉他们，在庭院中间的会幕的前面放上祭坛。人们可以进到庭院里去给神上贡和祭祀。当班的祭司们会收到人们带来的东西，然后贡到祭坛上，按照律法所要求的来用作祭祀。
  * The Tent of Meeting had a thick curtain hanging in the middle of it, which divided it into two rooms. The curtain was used as barrier to keep people from seeing the room on the other side, and to keep people from going into it. The first room was very holy, so only the priests could go into it. The second room was the most holy place, so only the high priest could go into it.
  * 会幕有个厚的帘子悬挂在中央，帘子把帐幕分成2个房间。帘子用做屏障，使人们看不到另一侧的房间，并且也不让人们进到那个房间里。第一个房间是非常神圣的，所以只有牧师们才能进去。第二个房间是最神圣的地方，所以只有大祭司方能进入。
