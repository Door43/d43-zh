====== New Covenant ======

新约

===== Definition: =====

定义：

God made a covenant with Israel through his prophet Moses, and later promised that he would make a New Covenant.

神借着他的先知摩西与以色列人立了约，之后他又应放要立一个新约。

  * The New Covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of everyone.
  * 新约比旧约更好因为新约是以耶稣为每个人的罪所作的牺牲为基础。
  * This New Covenant came into effect when God's Son died and came back to life.
  * 当神的儿子死且从死里复活的时候，这新约正式生效了。
  * Believers keep the New Covenant by trusting God to forgive them and save them because of the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus.
  * 借着相信神要因着耶稣牺牲的死和复活而赦免和拯救他们，信徒来遵守新约。
  * God writes the New Covenant on the hearts of believers. As a result of this, Christians want to obey God, and they begin to live holy lives that demonstrate that God is working in them.
  * 神把新约写在信徒的心里。这样的结果是，基督徒愿意去顺服神，他们也开始过一个圣洁的生活。这显明了神正在他们里面工作。
  * The New Covenant will be fulfilled when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was at creation. There will be no more sin, suffering, or injustice. Instead, all of God's people will dwell with him in peace, love, and harmony.
  * 当神在地上坚立他的治理时，新约要完全实现。一切要再一次成为很好的，就象在创造那时一样。不再有罪，受苦或者是不公。相反的，所有神的百姓都要与神同住，充满了平安，爱与和谐。

===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

圣经故事中的例子：

  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that he would make a **New Covenant**, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. In the **New Covenant**, God would write his law on the people's hearts, the people would know God personally, they would be his people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the **New Covenant**.
  * 虽然先知耶利米说神应许要立新约，但这个约跟神和以色列人在西乃所立的约是不同的。在新约里，神要把他的律法写要百姓的心里，百姓要自己认识神，他们要成为神的百姓，神要赦免他们的罪。弥赛亚要开始这新约。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:21-14|[21-14]]]** Through the Messiah's death and resurrection, God would accomplish his plan to save sinners and start the **New Covenant**.
  * 借着弥赛亚的受死和复活，神要完成他拯救罪人的计划，并开始新约。
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:38-05|[38-05]]]** Then Jesus took a cup and said, "Drink this. It is my blood of the **New Covenant**  that is poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me every time you drink it."
  * 然后耶稣拿起杯来说：“你们要喝这个。这是我立新约的血，为赦免罪而流出来的。你们要这样喝来记念我。”
  * **[[:zh:obs:notes:frames:48-11|[48-11]]]** But God has now made a **New Covenant**  that is available to everyone. Because of this **New Covenant**, anyone from any people group can become part of God's people by believing in Jesus.
  * 但现在神立了一个新约，是适合每个人的。因为这新约，无论任何人，来自任何团体都可以借着相信耶稣成为神的百姓。
