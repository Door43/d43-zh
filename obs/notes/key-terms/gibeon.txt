  * "Gibeonite" means "someone from the region called Gibeon."
  * “基遍人”是指“ 从基遍地区来的人。”
  * The Gibeonites had heard about how the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, and they were afraid. So the Gibeonites came to the leaders of Israel and pretended to be people from a far-away country.
  * 基遍人听到有关以色列人如何摧毁耶利哥的事， 他们就害怕 。 因此基遍人来到以色列首领前， 谎称他们是从一个遥远的国家来的人。
  * Israel made a treaty with the Gibeonites and did not destroy them.
  * 以色列人与基遍人立约，并没有毁灭他们。
