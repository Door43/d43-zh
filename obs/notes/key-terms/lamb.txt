羔羊,神的羔羊

===== Definition: =====

定义:

In the Bible, a lamb is a young sheep or goat. A sheep is a four-legged animal with a thick woolly hair. People raise them for their wool or as a source of food. Sheep are defenseless and timid. Goats are similar animals, and are used mainly for food.

在圣经中，羔羊是一只小的绵羊或山羊。 一只绵羊是四足动物长了厚厚的毛。人们养羊是为他们的羊毛或作为食物来源。绵羊是无助和胆怯的动物。山羊也是类似的动物，山羊主要是用于食用。

  * God's people used to sacrifice sheep and lambs to Him. The ones they sacrificed had to be physically perfect, with no defects.
  * 神的子民用绵羊和羔羊献祭给神。祭牲身体必须是完美，没有瑕疵。
  * Jesus is called the "Lamb of God" because he was morally perfect–completely without sin–and his sacrifice paid for people's sins.
  * 耶稣被称为“神的羔羊”，因为他在道德上是完美的——完全没有罪，而且他的牺牲是为人的罪付上代价。
