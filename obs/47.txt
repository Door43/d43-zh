几年之后，保罗和他的朋友西拉去了在腓立比地区的一个城，传讲关于耶稣基督的好消息，他们就遇到了一个卖紫色布的女人，她名字是叫吕底亚，她爱神并且敬拜神；
(BT Some years later,Paul and Silas went to the town of philippi, preaching the good news about Jesus,they met a women who selling purple clothe, she love God and worship God;)

上帝就打开她的心，可以明白关于耶稣基督的信息，她和她的家人全都受了洗。 她也邀请保罗和西拉住在他们的家中，他们就答应了；
(BT God open her heart to understand the message of Jesus christ, she and her whole family is baptized, she also invited Paul and Silas stay at her house, they agreed;)

God opened her heart to understand the message of Jesus, and she and her family were baptized. She invited Paul and Silas to stay at her house, so they did.

当保罗和西拉在腓立比的时候，他们经常去祷告。每天他们走到祷告的地方的时候， 有一个被鬼附身的使女跟着他们，这使女会算命，给她主人赚了很多钱。
(BT Paul and Silas often went to pray when they stay in Philippi, Every day when they walked to the place of prayer, A slave girl followed them who fullfilled by demon;)

Paul and Silas often went to pray while they were in Philippi. Every day as they walked to the place of prayer, a slave girl possessed by a demon followed them. She was a fortune teller, and she made a lot of money for her masters.

这使女不停地喊叫说：“这些人是至高神的仆人，他们正在告诉你们得救的方法道路。” 她经常这样喊叫，让保罗很心烦；
(BT This slave girl kept yelling : “these men are servants of most high God ,They are telling you a way to be save(saved).”she always do this (that) and? Paul became very angry;)

She kept yelling, “These men are servants of the Most High God. They are telling you the way to be saved!” She did this so often that Paul became annoyed.

有一天，保罗转向她，然后对那鬼说：“奉耶稣基督的名，从她身上出来”，那鬼立刻就出来了；
(BT One day , Paul turned to her , said to demon: “in the name of Jesus ,get out from her.” Right away the demon left her ;)

One day, Paul turned to her and said to the demon, “In the name of Jesus, come out of her.” Right away the demon left her.

当那使女的主人知道了这件事情之后，就变得非常生气，因为这使女再也不能为他赚更多的钱了；
(BT The men who owned the slave girl became very angry when he know these things happend , because this slave girl can not earn money (to) for him anymore;)

The men who owned the slave girl became very angry when they found out what had happened, because she could no longer make money for them.

所以，他们就把保罗和西拉逮捕了，打了他们，并把他们关进监狱中；
(BT So they arrested Paul and Silas, beaten and throw them to prison ;)

So they had Paul and Silas arrested, beaten, and thrown into jail.

保罗和西拉的脚被铁链锁上，并且被放在深牢中，在半夜的时候，他们就开始唱诗赞美神；

Paul and Silas were put in the most secure part of the prison with their feet locked up. In the middle of the night, they were singing songs of praise to God.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-47-09.jpg}}

突然，地大震动，监门全都开了，所有囚犯身上的锁链都掉了下来；

Suddenly, the earth shook and the prison doors flew open. All the prisoners’ chains fell off.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-47-10.jpg}}

当看守监狱的人看到监门全开之后，就要自杀，因为他以为所有的人都已经逃跑了（他知道若是他放走这些人他就将被杀），当保罗看到他，就喊：“住手，不要伤害自己，我们都在这里。”

When the jailer saw that the doors were open, he planned to kill himself, thinking that all the prisoners had escaped. (He knew he would be killed for letting the prisoners escape.) Paul saw him and yelled, “Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here.”

这狱卒就非常的害怕，然后他就把保罗和西拉带到自己的家中，给他们食物吃，并洗他们身上的伤，然后他说：“我当怎样行才可以得救？”

The jailer was terrified! He took Paul and Silas home, gave them some food, and washed their wounds. Then he said, “What must I do to be saved?”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-47-12.jpg}}

保罗回答说：“当信主耶稣基督，你和你的一家就必得救。”然后保罗就给狱卒和他的全家人都施了洗，然后他们就一起庆祝。

Paul answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your family will be saved.” Then Paul baptized the jailer and his whole family, and they celebrated together.

第二天，这座城的官长就放了保罗和西拉，并要求他们离开这座城市。于是保罗和西拉就去看望了吕底亚和其他的一些朋友，之后就离开了这座城市。关于耶稣的好消息继续在传扬，教会也在不断的成长；

The next day the leaders of the city freed Paul and Silas and asked them to leave Philippi. Paul and Silas visited Lydia and some other friends and then left the city. The Good News of Jesus kept spreading, and the Church kept growing.

保罗和其他一些基督徒领袖们去了很多的城市，传扬并教导人们关于耶稣，同时他们写了很多鼓励不同教会的信件，教导他们关于神所立的新约，他们所写的信就被称为：“新约”

Paul and other Christian leaders traveled to many cities, preaching and teaching about Jesus. They also wrote many letters to the churches to encourage and teach them about God’s New Covenant. These writings are called the New Testament.
