====== Christian ======

===== Definition: =====

After Jesus went back to heaven, people started calling his followers "Christians" because they were followers of Christ.

  * A Christian is a person who follows Jesus. He believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and he trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
  * In our modern times, often the term "Christian" is used for someone who believes in the religion, but who is not really following Jesus. This is not the meaning of "Christian" in the Bible.
  * Because the term "Christian" in the Bible always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus, a Christian is also called a "believer."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term could be translated as "Christ-follower" or "follower of Christ" or perhaps something like, "Christ-person."
  * Make sure that the translation of this term is distinct from terms used for disciple or apostle.
  * Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.
  * Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]])
