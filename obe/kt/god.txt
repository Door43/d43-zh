====== God ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Bible, the term "God" refers to the eternal being named "Yahweh," who created the universe out of nothing. Yahweh exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

  * God-ព្រះ has always existed – he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.
  * He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.
  * God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
  * He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
  * People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.
  * God revealed his name as "Yahweh" which means, "he is" or "I am" or "the One who (always) exists."
  * The Bible also teaches about false "gods" which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "God" could be translated with a word or phrase that means, "Deity" or "Creator" or "Supreme Being."
  * Other ways to translate "God" might include, "Supreme Creator" or "Infinite Sovereign Lord" or "Eternal Supreme Being."
  * Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for "God" in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.
  * English translations refer to a false god using a small "g" and write God with a large "G" when referring to the one true God. Other languages may also choose to do that. Another way to distinguish them would be to use two different terms for "God" and "god."
  * The phrase, "I will be their God and they will be my people" could also be translated as, "I, God, will rule over these people; they will belong to me and worship me."
