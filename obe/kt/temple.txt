===== Facts: =====

The temple was a building surrounded by walled courtyards where the Israelites came to pray and to offer sacrifices to God. It was located on Mount Moriah in the city of Jerusalem.

  * The temple building had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.
  * God referred to the temple as his dwelling place.
  * In the New Testament, the term "temple of the Holy Spirit" is used to refer to believers in Jesus, because the Holy Spirit lives in them.

  * When it refers specifically to the building itself, some translations will translate "temple" as "temple building," to make it clear what is being referred to.
  * Ways to translate "temple" could include, "God's holy house" or "sacred worship place."
