====== iniquity ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "iniquity" is a word that is very similar in meaning to the term "sin," but may more specifically refer to conscious acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness.

  * "Iniquity" could be defined as deliberate, harmful actions against other people.
  * Other definitions of iniquity include "perversity" and "depravity," which are both words that describe conditions of terrible sin.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "iniquity" could be translated as "wickedness" or "perverse actions" or "harmful acts."
  * Often, "iniquity" occurs in the same text as the word "sin," so it is important to have two different ways of translating these two terms.
