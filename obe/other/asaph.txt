====== Asaph ======

===== Facts: =====

Asaph, probably a Levite priest, was associated with temple musicians. Appointed by King David, he was one of three individuals who were responsible for the "service of song" in the temple and founded families or guilds which continued the assignment.

  * Psalms 50 and 73-83 are ascribed to Asaph. It is uncertain if he or his family actually composed these Psalms.
  * Some of the songs took on the form of prophecy.
