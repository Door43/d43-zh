====== Gilgal ======

===== Facts: =====

The term Gilgal was a town north of Jericho and was the first place that the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River to enter Canaan.

  * At Gilgal, Joshua set up twelve stones taken from the dry river bed of the Jordan River that they had just crossed over.
  * Gilgal was the city that Elijah and Elisha were leaving as they crossed the Jordan when Elijah was taken up to heaven.
  * There were also several other places called "Gilgal" in the Old Testament.
  * The word "gilgal" means "circle of stones," perhaps referring to a place where a circular altar was built. It is also related to the word for something that rolls.
  * The word almost always occurs in the phrase, "the gilgal," which may indicate that this was a general reference to a kind of place, rather than to a specific place name.
