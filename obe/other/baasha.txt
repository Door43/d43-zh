====== Baasha ======

===== Facts: =====

Baasha was one of Israel's evil kings.

  * Baasha reigned over Israel when Asa was king of Judah (approximately 900 B.C.)
  * During Baasha's reign there was constant warring and friction between Israel and Judah's kings. Baasha's many sins caused God to eventually remove him from office by his eventual death.
