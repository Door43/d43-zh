==== Statement of Faith ====

The [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] is subscribed to by all member organizations of and contributors to the unfoldingWord project. It is in agreement with the Lausanne Covenant.

==== Translation Guidelines ====

The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that is:

  - **Accurate**  - Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:
  - **Affirmed by the Church**  - Endorsed and used by the Church.
Read the information on the **[[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]** page to learn the best way to translate the stories.

If you agree with the Statement of Faith and intend to follow the Translation Guidelines, then begin translating the source text into the language you selected.

==== Use the Translation Notes Pages ====

You can click here to go to [[:en:obs:notes:31|Jesus Walks on Water]] story with translation helps.

This [[http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE|video]] (1 minute 20 seconds) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes on the story picture pages.

  * The stories are separated into separate pages by the pictures (called frames).
  * Each page has the picture and the text, in a national trade language, from the story.
  * There are bold words in the text. These are very important words that need to be translated correctly. Click on the bold word to go to another page that will give more information on how to translate the very important word.
  * Translation Notes explains how to translate some of the important words in the story. The definition of the word or phrase should help you understand how to translate.

==== Translate from the Source Language ====

It is best to open the webpage of the story in your language and the webpage of the story with Translation Notes.

This [[http://youtu.be/73tAlcffiLU|video]] (10 minutes) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes when translating. The Translation Notes pages are designed to help write accurate translations.

The video assumes you understand the above instructions. The video uses the graphical editor. Here is a summary of the process:

  * Find stories in your heart language that have not been translated that you want to work on.
  * Open the Translation Notes in a new window and arrange the windows side-by-side.
  * Have both the [[en:obs:notes:01|Translation Notes]] and the Heart Language windows on the same story.
  * In the Translation Notes window note the Picture or Frame Number (number in [ ] after the story title).
  * Open the graphical (CKG Edit) editor in the heart language window and scroll down to the desired frame. Compare the picture .
  * Read the Notes for help on how to translate some of the words and terms.

**Once you have chosen the correct words or terms in your language, arrange the translated words so they make sense and the stories are easy to read and understand.**

  * Continue editing frames and saving your work.
  * Enjoy and share the new translation.
